<p class = "title"> 
Doyin could hardly breathe under the unblushing sun of the bleachers, and so it astonished her that Niyi could contrive to dart around the torrid court for two hours. Add to that that he did not walk on wing&#232;d feet. He was not a natural runner. Rather, his strengths were in his springiness and force. He was therefore an unlikely tennis champion. 
<br>
He had a lovely, gradual serve, however, and could be depended upon to achieve an ace per game, without conceding any. With every point that he gained, her relief made her stomach drop, with the result that she felt revoltingly nauseous in addition to feeling faint. Her heart pounded fearfully throughout each set, in spite of her secret conviction she did not care whether or not he won. How many times had she said so to herself? Yet, when it was over, she wasn&#39;t sure that she could stand.
<br> 
She watched him shake the hand of his opponent grimly over the rim of the net. The sweat poured from his scalp and along his temples. Half an hour later, she sagged against him as he spoke to the other players on his team with the strange exactness that was peculiar to his speech. She couldn&#39;t follow their conversation because she felt so muzzy and weak. He laughed with his coaches, and it unnerved her because he laughed so rarely.
<br>
He took her back to her dorm room, having realized that something was the matter with her.
<br>
&#34;It&#39;s because you don&#39;t eat,&#34; He insisted, making her sit down on the edge of her well-made bed.
<br>
&#34;I think I&#39;m going to throw up.&#34;
<br>
He handed her his steel water bottle and then vanished into her bathroom. She heard the noise of the shower.
<br>
&#34;Niyi, I can&#39;t.&#34;
<br>
He reappeared. 
<br>
&#34;Drink that - quickly.&#34;
<br>
She drank, following orders as she always did with him. She was horrified when he began to undress her, having committed herself from the very beginning to a need for absolute control as concerned her appearance, and especially her nude appearance, when it came to him. But she felt that there was no limit to her exhaustion except death - she literally could not move - and behind that there was a frightening curiosity. 
<br>
She also didn&#39;t want to cry, which she thought was what might happen if she opened her mouth to argue with him. Niyi helped her into the bathroom and made her sit on the shower floor, right underneath the glacial stream. He didn&#39;t stay, but left her alone there, and after no more than four or five minutes, she re-emerged in a towel to find him on her bed, scrolling his phone. 
<br>
The pale blue of her striped sheets complimented both the whiteness of his clothes and the cool darkness of his skin. 
<br>
&#34;Better?&#34; He asked.
<br>
She would have done anything for him. But he said, &#34;No, I&#39;m tired,&#34; and stood and hoisted his racquet bag on his shoulder. &#34;I&#39;ll see you on Monday. Eat something.&#34;
<br>
And then he left. Following a four-hour nap, Doyin rallied. He had left her his water bottle, and she sat up in bed and groaned and drank from it. Jazz tunes floated mystically through the wall which adjoined the room of her neighbor. Duke Ellington. Given their tinniness, they seemed to come not from a speaker but from some sort of toy or music box. Her phone began to ring.
<br>
It was Lucien, who was annoyed because she hadn&#39;t been responding to her texts. Gal was with her. They were supposed to have met somewhere over half an hour prior. The three had plans to go to a party that evening, where a DJ of whom they knew was going to perform a set. Lucien was driving - a car had been borrowed because it was out of town.
<br>
Doyin ate all the walnuts in a bag of walnuts - one of many she had stashed under her bed for situations such as these - and quickly dressed herself in light pink mesh. She was smearing lip gloss over her eyelids when her phone began to ring again. She leapt toward it, but didn&#39;t answer the call, instead collecting her wallet from her bedside table and rushing from the room. 
<br>
She applied her lipstick on the stairs and was surprised to find, when she emerged from her building, that night had fallen. Lucien and Gal honked from the end of the crescent. Doyin was so disturbed by the noise, by the prospect of the email that she expected to receive about it from some administrator or peer in the morning, that she didn&#39;t even remark the color of the car that she was entering. It was some kind of SUV. 
<br>
As soon as she was in, the music started and went through her skin.
<br>
&#34;Where <I>were</I> you? &#8230;Do you want this?&#34;
<br>
An indigo pill in the shape of a flying saucer sat in Lucien’s palm. Doyin took it.
<br>
&#34;I was sleeping.&#34;
<br>
&#34;Were you? Poor baby.&#34;
<br>
Taste of vermouth. Gal was driving. She drove too fast. The music sort of galled her, in a good way. Doyin leaned forward between her friends, who sat in the front, but she didn&#39;t hear their conversation. Consciousness ballooned strangely within her. The purple pill. She was most aware of herself when they drove over the bridge, where there was a little traffic. 
<br>
She looked ahead at the candy-lights of many cars on their lane, and the high beams streaking on the other side. She thought of the black water pulsing below somewhere and listened to her heartbeat. Something was happening.
<br>
&#x2731
<br>
Dancing. It had turned out to be a run-down house on a creepy street of run-down houses, which were tall, narrow, and spaced far apart from each other. Lucien read the numbers aloud until they came to number ten. They could hear the music coming from down in the basement. 
<br>
No one had answered the door, of course, when they had knocked, but it was open, and so they had let themselves in. They were greeted by a brindled gray cat, who, sidling slowly down the staircase in the front hall, had seemed at first to be either a ghost or a shadow. No lights were on, and they only saw her due to the sickly, white mist emitted by the nearest lamppost, oozing through the sidelights. 
<br>
&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; Gal murmured.
<br>
Following the music, they passed by the staircase and went down the narrow corridor that led to the kitchen, where there was another doorway, in which two tall, long-haired specters awaited them.
&#34;Tickets,&#34; one of them said.
<br>
Doyin observed that they were identical, down to the cuts on their lips. Both gorgeous. Lucien used her phone to show them the tickets, which she had purchased a week ago. They studied her screen for a long time, and Doyin wondered whether they would be turned away on the basis of their dress, or some other superficial reason. They were very colorful tonight: herself in pink, Gal in green, and Lucien in her usual red and blue. Lucien looked particularly good - fresh-faced. Her beauty would get them in, and if not, then her arrogance. They were playing the filthy and textured music that she particularly liked dancing to.
<br>
When they got downstairs, it occurred to her that Niyi would hate it. He did like to dance, but above ground, or better still, outdoors, on a warm evening, on someone&#39;s birthday. She had gone with him to family functions in La—, and he did very well at those.
<br>
Here, you couldn&#39;t really see anyone&#39;s face. The only light coming from anywhere, other than the turntable and phone screens, was a deep, obliterating crimson. Lucien passed around a flask that she had carried in her bag. There was no sign of any alcohol, not even the rudimentary bar that they were expecting. There might be other refreshments, if they knew the right people, but they didn&#39;t know anyone, and in any case, other than Gal, who was driving, they had had their pill.
<br>
The three women danced, but only one of them lost herself. Only Lucien liked music. The others preferred silence, but didn&#39;t know it because it had become so rare that it seemed peculiar and otherworldly. Doyin was full of obscure concerns about Niyi. He had often asked her whether she thought about him when he wasn&#39;t there. And when she said yes, he seemed to have difficulty crediting it. Whereas she was afraid even to ask the question. 
<br>
They left around 1:45, but were stopped in the front hall by a man in glasses and slippers holding the cat. Doyin thought he was a man, but he might have been a teenager.
<br>
&#34;Is Yuri still down there?&#34; He asked them.
<br>
&#34;We don&#39;t know Yuri,&#34; Lucien said.
<br>
He frowned.
<br>
&#34;Aren&#39;t you here for his birthday?&#34;
<br>
&#34;No. Sorry.&#34;
<br>
&#34;So you just wander into people&#39;s houses.&#34;
<br>
Lucien stroked the brindled cat between her ears.
<br>
&#34;That&#39;s not what happened,&#34; she said.
<br>
The teenager narrowed his eyes. 
<br>
&#34;We bought tickets,&#34; Lucien explained. &#34;It was advertised as a public event. You <I>must</I> know that.&#34;
<br>
&#34;No. That wasn&#39;t my understanding.&#34;
<br>
There was a pause, wherein the cat purred and purred under Lucien’s hand.
<br>
&#34;Well, it looks like you weren&#39;t invited either,&#34; Gal remarked.
<br>
&#34;What do you mean?&#34;
<br>
&#34;You&#39;re in pajamas.&#34;
<br>
He studied her.
<br>
&#34;Yuri&#39;s my best friend.&#34;
<br>
&#34;And you&#39;re in love.&#34; Lucien grinned.
<br>
He tensed in a way that let them all know it was true.
<br>
&#34;Is this your house?&#34; Asked Doyin, curious.
<br>
&#34;No, I&#39;m just here for the week.&#34;
<br>
The friends departed.
<br>
&#x2731
<br>
Doyin and Lucien dreamt in the car. Doyin dreamt of tennis in the freshness of spring - game, set, match! And Lucien dreamt of her stalkers; there were two from her high school days, but only one since starting college.
