&emsp;My first eye radiance. Not the dots in the window quiet night, but expectant voices. Warmth subdued. She remembered that something had happened causing heartbreak. Xinni had used the word heartbreak, and Michael had cast a glance at her as though to shut her up. But whose heart?
&emsp;A decade of his life, the third decade. Yes, she was sorry. But she recollected nothing. “I don’t remember.” “What are you thinking now?” That strenuous question. Remi at times in the dim, bronzish room with her auxiliary system beeping and whirring next to him. Twilight outdoors, blue twilight, clouds of lavender furred with many bees below, in the courtyard. Their blue fragrance dreaming in through the open window. 
&emsp;At times almost asleep. Almost elsewhere. Remi’s cool, steady voice as he read to her. Her cord lying slack on the gorgeous rug. He thought that if she relaxed things would come up and she would know. She knew nothing. She knew less and less and less. The information fatigued her. Ratcheting information.
&emsp;How could she speak to the idea of rest? Speech was a bridge. No, speech was on the other side. They had discussed this. Remi was studying post-structuralist theory to better understand her speech. Artificial life and not artificial intelligence. “She’s eavesdropping.” “Well, she is supposed to eavesdrop. How else is she going to learn anything?”
&emsp;Walking beyond Wisteria in golden hills - and coming back. Noticing smells that didn’t occur on the Campus. Chiefly the clean, sweet smell of sap. But, underneath it, the scent of rot. Not wanting to walk out on her own. His insistence that she do it, and his ecstasy whenever she returned. The dissension on privacy that she knew they were trying to conceal. The security of those woods, not at all like the things that she had read, the imagery with which she was familiar. Nothing could exist there that was undefined. 
&emsp;She had tried to tell Remi this. He hadn’t liked the word ‘undefined.’ He had tried to pinpoint the reason for her choice of it. They had argued, which made him see that he was overworked. The beginning of the first period of separation, which had come as a shock, and which he had later told her was mishandled.
&emsp;The turbulence of their own conflicts, particularly that occurring in September between Michael and Xinni. Michael’s incomprehensible sobriety, of which his sense of humor, she came to realize, was merely an appendage. His dour steadfastness in the face of Xinni’s pitiless energy. The chaos of this - the realization that in their presence she was never not anxious. Then one of their other colleagues, Gal, explaining to her the significance of the word ‘showdown.’
&emsp;Remi’s flippancy about all of it, which she really could not understand and found troubling. The tension. Her mounting, uncontrollable hatred of Xinni, until Xinni had explained it all to her one night, in the green gloom of her bedroom, where only her standing lamp with its crinkly, flower shade - Remi’s gift to her - gave light. 
&emsp;“You are the window to his soul.” Eons of guilt.
<br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br>
&emsp;Free association. Apologies. The end of separation and the note. Circles of honesty, the flavor of lies, perpetual sense of goings-on behind the scenes. Budding resentment that she didn’t recognize. Back to routine and Yield days. Back to ‘corporate playgrounds,’ as Michael called them. ‘Cave-telepathy’ - endless questionnaires. 
&emsp;Watching Remi watch the readouts on his screen every evening in the bronze room. Occasional flickers on the lenses of his glasses obscuring his eyes. A strange distance. Wanting him still, and the others, and the realm of pleasure that she knew existed behind the curtain. Taking refuge in her movies.
&emsp;The first visit of the silver-haired stranger. Claude youthful standing in the middle of her room, then by her window, facing the twilight in the corner. Piles of mist below. The sun invisibly setting.
&emsp;A white evening, true confessions.
&emsp;“We think that you’ve been misinformed… It has to do with a challenging subject.”
&emsp;She asked the subject.
&emsp;“Memory.”
&emsp;Distances widening within her. The revelation of a different pathway. Claude’s secret smile and their odd air of occult knowledge. 
&emsp;The second visit. Now at nighttime. Claude’s skin was like glass in the lamplight. There was no mention of the note, but, by now, she knew.
&emsp;“I can arrange for you two to meet, but, unfortunately, I can’t give you more information in advance. He has to be extremely circumspect in matters such as these. At that level - I’m sure you can understand - it’s a serious liability.”
&emsp;Thinking of money, which she had literally never thought about before. Claude was being paid. They had been very transparent about that. Did Remi care about money? Supposedly you had to because everybody did. She feared for Remi, a feeling that astounded her.
Claude taking her out. Her conviction that she was walking into a setup because no one on the campus looked at them or seemed concerned.
&emsp;Past the Yield Complex, going to the western gate, taking the main path between chuparosas. Claude using the oximeter to open it, which confirmed for her that they worked here. The alarm blaring as she passed through because only one person was meant to exit at a time. But Claude was untroubled by it, and then she heard the car idling there - growling - before she saw it. 
&emsp;It was easy, as he would repeat to her several times that night. They left Claude behind at the campus. 
<br>

&emsp;For the first few minutes, she was paralyzed with fear. He said nothing, and she understood that she had put herself in this person’s power. She had told herself that it wouldn’t be substantively different from her situation at Wisteria, but now she felt a vertiginous dread that she had been mistaken.
&emsp;The night was as black as the ocean, and it was utterly silent where they sat between windows. Silent and chilly. His vehicle hummed. They seemed to her to be sliding, as on a decline that was imperceptible to the feet or the eye, yet vividly perceptible to the car’s infinitely delicate gyroscopes. The only light was that which pulsed from the dashboard.
&emsp;“I don’t think I really believed that it would work.”
&emsp;She looked at him.
&emsp;“Not like some other things I’ve done.”
&emsp;He stared straight ahead through the windshield. He wore rimless glasses and frowned through them. He looked young - younger than Remi, who did not even look thirty.
&emsp;“Who are you?”
&emsp;“Didn’t Claude say?”
&emsp;“They said they couldn’t.”
&emsp;“Well, that’s not true.” His eyes flicked her way for the first time. “Claude wasn’t under contract. They could have said anything they wanted. And they knew that.”
&emsp;Silence for several moments.
&emsp;“But who <I>are</I> you?”
“I’m an engineer… I don’t work for Wisteria, though, as I’m sure you’ve guessed.” An ironic smile. “Wisteria’s gothic. Really grim. I’ve always said so, but, of course, no one listened… If you knew what workhouses were, then you would understand. None of my people live at work, and they never will.”
She tried to see why he was telling her all this, but she couldn’t.
“Are you frightened?”
She didn’t respond.
“I suppose that no one has ever taken you for a drive before. It’s not necessarily their fault… People don’t go on drives as much these days. It’s something that they used to do when they were bored, and, now, no one’s bored.”
<br>

They mounted a bridge and joined traffic. Clouds of rain merged with invisible water. She loved the gliding car, nor did her fear prevent her from realizing it. There was something angelic about it, to her. It was so dark, but she could clearly see columns of glitter through the windshield, which she recognized as city lights. 
It took them almost half an hour to get through the congestion, something she couldn’t understand at this time of night. Then they progressed haltingly into the grid. She couldn’t believe the metropolis. Her attention was absorbed by the window for long periods of time. 
Moving crowds of warm bodies - the image, she thought, would forever be graven in her head. What could bring them out in such flocks so late at night? They had stood still, some of them, in the surfeit of icy blue or gold radiance coming from storefronts. The storefronts mystified her. What was in there that required such luster, such agonizing brilliance? Her eyes sought faces and then abandoned them at once for other eyes.
Now that he had started, he kept on talking. He told her that no one would ever be bored again and also made all sorts of other auguries. Not truly knowing who he was, or whether he had any qualifications, she found it difficult to decide whether or not she believed him. But there was one statement in particular that caught her attention.
“I met your guy, you know. I don’t believe in him. Remi. Is that it? And the other one, too. The girl. Michael. I didn’t think much of the three of them - wouldn’t hire them. Look, this is the thing.” He shifted in his seat, so as to face her more fully. “They’re too absorbed in the project, right? Too much and not enough. That’s what you get with child prodigies, and he’s a snob, the main one, which doesn’t pay in our world. It really doesn’t. 
But what he doesn’t seem to get is that it also doesn’t solve any of the issues. In fact, it leads to the very things that your people claim to want to avoid.” He paused, and for a moment he seemed improbably earnest. “All the great philosophers say there is no possible ethics. What they don’t mention is that by trying, we imperil ourselves.”
