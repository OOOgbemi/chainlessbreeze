<br>
&emsp;The sixth one fiddled with his watch, embedded in the face of which were tiny, glittering symbols. These were hand-painted, she knew (for she&#39;d read a feature on the horologist who had designed this particular watch) and built to change configurations by the hour. Yet the obsessive artistry that was revealed in their gradients - blue-green chiaroscuro - limpid, trapezoidal sunbeams - also lent them a Th&#233;atre &#224; la Mode toyishness. Snugly encased within a window behind the dial were a smirking moon, a scowling sun, comets, stars, clouds, hills, and phantasmal animal-figures. 
<br>
&emsp;Oju admired the watch and tried to admire the wearer. She did so in spite of her promise to herself and to Tom that she wouldn&#39;t, under any circumstances, &#39;try&#39; to do a single thing. But it made no difference, and at the end of the night, just before she went to sleep, she confessed to her journal that it had been his whining laugh that put her off, which was both true and not.
<br>
&emsp;In the end, she considered herself lucky, for he woke up once after Desdemona had left. 4:31, and they curled up together in the money chair, which was what her ex-husband had called it, not believing that comfort was something you could pay for. Spending money, was, to him, the definition of discomfort, and, though Oju sympathized, she resented a situation in which the price of the money chair had so disgusted him that he had had to keep on reminding them of it over the course of their divorce, as though that were the culprit. She knew - though she had never said it to him - she felt she knew without a doubt that money and comfort were the same. But while she preferred comfort to possibility, he had much preferred possibility to comfort. She had learned that.
<br>
&emsp;Daybreak now. Hoisting Deji in her arms, which ached already in the most familiar way, she drew the curtains and looked out over the lambent field of skyscrapers. The prospect was pale blue and still as a picture, indistinct. 
<br>
&emsp;Her true companion. They returned to the money chair. He didn&#39;t want anything - she had asked him. His solemn, black eyes still twinkled with the tears that he had shed to wake her up. But he wouldn&#39;t eat. He just wanted her company. 
<br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You have to think about what you want.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju was thinking about the kheer that she had had the previous Friday for dessert with Tom. It had been ice-cold, and the flavors of cardamom and saffron had also struck her as somehow cold in that conjunction. Cold and floral.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;As you know, not many people get to make this jump. And the ones who do are the ones who really, really want it. No! Sorry - they are a tiny subset of those people.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;With her fingernail, Oju tapped the three-flippered base of the tarnished egg cup on her plate, enjoying the quiet pings under the chaos of voices. The restaurant in which she and her agent Addy were having breakfast was designed to look and sound busy, even when it was almost empty. 
<br>
&emsp;It had surprised her, this morning, when she arrived, to find that she still enjoyed being here somewhat - that the curved, oxblood booths, the desilvered mirrors, and the vast, lustrous pastry counter still thrilled and delighted her, so many years after having fled to the city. She supposed that it could never lose all of its appeal for her, given that it spoke, in its considered tawdriness, to an outsider&#39;s dream of what this city had supposedly once been. She liked to order their eggs and soldiers, with the butter medallion that came in its own blue china vessel and the mysterious dollops of bright condiments that starred the plate. 
<br>
&emsp;As she buttered a soldier, she admitted to herself that she understood what good old Addy had been saying. She would even have argued that she understood him perfectly. But his conclusions about the way of the world seemed just impossibly abstract. There was something funny about them - or it was her own thinking that had gone funny. She couldn&#39;t say which. The fact was that, ever since Deji&#39;s birth, there had existed a new wooliness in certain areas of her mind and a new clarity in others, such that any assessment or conclusion with even a hint of cynicism in it didn&#39;t seem to her really to apply to her self or her situation. Not in any serious way.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Something sustainable and quiet&#8230; That&#39;s what I want, mainly for him.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;It felt like the thousandth time that she&#39;d said it. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I know,&#34; Addy grated. He chose to speak hoarsely when he was mad, rather than raising his voice. It was just one example of his tact. &#34;And you and I have discussed several different strategies around that. But, as I&#39;ve said before, Oju, I believe that this movie is the gateway to all of it. Everything. This is your ticket. And that&#39;s my professional opinion.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju felt strangely ashamed. How on earth had she gotten here with Addy? When did this particular bargain - exposure for money, and money for privacy - begin to seem clear and legitimate? Yet everyone was doing it. Her ticket where?
<br>
&emsp;&#34;&#8230;What did you say the director&#39;s name was?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;He&#39;s well respected,&#34; Addy chewed cheerfully. &#34;His films are considered art.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But what&#39;s his name?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Name's Dahl. Lewis-Hector Dahl.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju caught her own anxious gaze in the mirror directly behind Addy&#39;s head. Instinctively, and before she could stop herself, she assessed her features and concluded that she looked right. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You&#39;ve seen his stuff. You have,&#34; Addy insisted. &#34;You just don&#39;t remember.&#34;
<br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But what would you be <I>like</I> in it?&#34; Tom murmured.
<br>
&emsp;They were in Oju&#39;s bed with Deji sound asleep next door. There was the fragrance aloft of numerous perfumed candles, a fantasy of myrrh and vetiver. The bronzish lamplight dropped aslant on Tom&#39;s lovely skin. Oju watched her. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well&#8230; I haven&#39;t gotten the script yet. They forgot to send it. But Addy assured me that it&#39;s not much of a role. My name is &#39;Prettyish Escort&#8230;&#39; Only a week&#39;s commitment, is what they said. Plus ADR.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Lying on her side over the duvet, Oju waited as Tom gave thought to the idea. Her brows had sunk to hover just above the frames of her round glasses. Her hair was swept away from her face and tied in a slipshod way. Haphazard-baby-mode. She had worked from home with baby, and she was still wearing the white cotton t-shirt and stripy blue shorts in which she had woken that morning. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well? Worth a shot,&#34; She finally said.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Do you think so?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Tom shrugged, smiling a smile that Oju read as sardonic.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;There&#39;s no law that says it needs to be your calling.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;The way Tom spoke - distinctly and with calm authority, never shouting and never, ever muttering - had always been a consolation to Oju. They were raising her baby together.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I told Addy that I wasn&#39;t trained as an actress,&#34; She said at length.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well, he already knew that. Didn&#39;t he?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes, he did&#8230; I&#39;m trying to tell you his response.&#34; Oju propped herself up on her elbows. &#34;He said, &#39;That&#39;s not the reason that Dahl wanted you.&#39;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Stupid bastard.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I mean, it&#39;s fine. But the reason I&#39;m telling you is because, you know, it sort of seems like it could be an indication.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;By the end of her speech, she was almost whispering. She realized that she was ashamed of herself, or rather of what she had long understood as her innate fragility. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well, I don&#39;t expect him to know what he&#39;s talking about, Addy. Dahl&#39;s films are good.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju, surprised, sat up properly. &#34;You&#39;ve seen them?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ve seen one or two.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She peered at Tom&#39;s frowning profile, trying to see through her reserve.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;If you say they&#39;re good, then I&#39;ll do it.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Don&#39;t hinge your decision on my taste&#8230; Anyway, it almost doesn&#39;t matter if it's good. I imagine that seeing yourself onscreen can only ever be spectacle.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju rested her chin in her hands, thinking to herself that she loved spectacle, but had never thought to <I>be</I> one.
<br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br>
&emsp;The seventh one. The seventh was chosen for his looks and was not famous like the first. Tom approved of judging a book by its cover. It was so much more disheartening when people you chose on their merits inevitably were who they were. 
<br>
&emsp;Oju wore white when she saw him, and he wore blue. They spoke about current events. It had surprised her that he was willing to go there. But - and she didn&#39;t realize this until hours after the date - he spoke with a curious abstraction that revealed nothing about the way in which he consumed news. She couldn&#39;t tell whether he spent far too much of his time online, or none whatsoever. And his relationship to the internet was what interested her because he was very clearly therapized, and she had rather enjoyed his conversation. 
<br>
&emsp;He gave her the not distasteful impression, overall, of being a man with more than one older sister. But when she saw pictures of them on the internet the following day, she realized that she was not up for it. She had kept zooming in to the side of his face at breakfast - until Tom had asked her what she was frowning at. Then she'd stopped. He had looked nothing like himself. She could not connect his appearance in the image with the person whom she had seen the previous night. He seemed to her to be an absolute stranger.
<br>
&emsp;Meanwhile, Deji ate his blue and strawberries, while Tom strode from room to room, busily lifting up objects and putting them down in other spots. She was attempting to assemble her possessions, since she planned to go straight home from the office after work that day. She preferred to be in her own apartment, this week, because the next few days were scheduled to be in-person, and her commute was much easier from where she lived. 
<br>
&emsp;There was a podcast on, beaming quietly through the speaker in the kitchen. A journalist interviewed a science communicator about cosmology. But the journalist was for some reason sharing her star sign. 
<br>
&emsp;Oju helped Deji to eat breakfast. He enjoyed his food and ate with focus. Strange baby.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You know, you could have brought him back; I would have stayed in the guest room,&#34; said Tom.
<br>
&emsp;Oju smiled through her lethargy. It always took her several hours to wake up.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And how would that have worked?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; She called from the nook with all of Oju&#39;s books in it, which had also become her study. &#34;&#8230;You could have texted me.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju supposed that that was true. But it still didn&#39;t feel quite right. He had done nothing to make her want him in her home. The only reason she didn&#39;t say so was that she wanted Tom to go on talking.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;There&#39;s baby, too.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I am <I>ab</I>solutely certain that what the baby wants is for you to enjoy yourself.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Tom reappeared in the passageway, grinning and dressed for the office.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;<I>We</I> should get married,&#34; Oju suggested for the hundredth time.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;We <I>are</I> married. This <I>is</I> the marriage.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Tom had made such statements before, but not with this precise wording, and as a result Oju understood her slightly differently today. This was the marriage because they ran a household together and shared the labor of childcare. The men whom she was seeing - what were they for? Entertainment? She ought to take them a little less seriously, if she could, and then perhaps they wouldn&#39;t bore her so much when she was with them and depress her as soon as they had gone.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ve got to go,&#34; said Tom, coming forward to kiss Deji&#39;s crown. 
<br>
&emsp;He turned to her. Strained toward her. She kissed Oju&#39;s next.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ll see you later.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Dinner plans?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Oju was feeling preemptively lonely.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No. We can go to dinner.&#34; She was at the door. &#34;But on the day, I don&#39;t know&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ll take care of it,&#34; said Oju, not wanting her to be late. 
<br>
&emsp;Tom left for work, and Oju reflected upon her remarkable confidence in her ability to make her happy. Perhaps a delusional confidence, as she had sometimes thought. The issue - the catch, so to speak - was that she and Tom had been close friends for years. There was no way to be prudent, therefore, about a transition to other forms of relationship. It would need to be all or nothing. 
<br>
&emsp;And, what was more, she felt actually guilty considering it in Deji&#39;s presence. What a disruption to his life! No, better to go on as they were, and if her relationship with Tom was an impediment to other serious bonds that she might nurture or cultivate, she knew which she prioritized. Tom was already a part of their family.
<br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br>
&emsp;On Friday, Oju left the United States so as to have pictures taken of her in Tired Bay, which, she had been told, was a paradise in the West Indies. She was an anxious flier, and so she had had to face the necessity of calling Tom numerous times before and between flights and then switching to video-chat. On the first leg of her trip, she also took the precaution of swallowing a pill that she had been prescribed for this particular issue, which diluted her adrenaline effectively, but could not quite silence her thoughts.
<br>
&emsp;Tom told her that she was spending the evening at the apartment with the baby and Oju&#39;s father, who was there to take care of his grandchild while his daughter was away. Deji had not yet learned to be interested in video of his mother, and that was just how they liked it. She never asked Tom or anyone else to pass him the phone. Instead, she gave them messages for him, and sometimes, if it was a longer trip, she wrote him one or three letters.
<br>
&emsp;Perching on an iron chair before the noisy, golden glare of several designer stores, Oju listened to Tom talking about nothing in particular and felt calmer. Or rather, she felt that there was a sort of lid on her panic. Tom displaced the phone from surface to surface as she moved through the apartment. 
<br>
&emsp;When Oju was not on the phone with her, she took walks and listened to the playlist of ambient songs that Tom had made her for airports. Oju despised lounges, which she felt were everywhere flooded with an inevitable atmosphere of complacency that was almost mystically egregious in the context of air travel. They formed for her a personal taboo of real danger, and nothing would have persuaded her to eat or drink or in one. But she had also noticed that she felt significantly less frightened when in motion. Walking forced her thoughts into a kind of harmony with the rhythm of her steps. They could no longer bounce erratically from one catastrophic vision to another. 
<br>
&emsp;And the music on the playlist, which was over seven hours long, gave her a feeling of boundedness (bound as in held and tethered, but also bound for a specific place), as opposed to the impression of endless distance and the basic terror of a serious fall that would ordinarily have attended a plane journey for her. She recollected Tom telling her that that had to do with the connection between music and mathematics. 
<br>
&emsp;Or had Tom only been speculating? Oju couldn&#39;t remember. Yet, as she crossed the eternal fluorescence between gates, next to autowalks that hummed their solitude, she was astonished by her own sense of calm. She thought of her baby, who must still be in the bedtime process with her father.
