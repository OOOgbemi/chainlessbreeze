<u>Friend</u>
<br>My idea of us does involve
<br>those lilac nights that you mentioned -
<br>I don&#39;t expect lilac 
<br>from saints, from lovers false
<br>or lovers true.
<br><br>
There is no candor on earth but your own;
<br>I'm telling you
<br>that devotion is a state of suspense&#59; suspense a state of devotion.
<br>
<br>Whom do you love, 
<br>imagining him
<br>in cloisters?
<br><br>

<u>Island Paradise</u>
<br>Now and now and now at the glimmering bourn 
<br>of the only surviving coral reef,
<br>Hugh and I 
<br>are conducting a big stakeout. We lie in wait 
<br>for another brawny red snapper, our Sunday lunch.
<br>Something to eat.
<br>
<br>Assurances are daily ferried on the backs of whales and dolphins to the beach, 
<br>and yet I observe that the significant others 
<br>are still bellyaching on the strand.
<br>
<br>I detect in the surf 
<br>the ghost 
<br>of a swashbuckling teenager, 
<br>while the sun carefully updates her record of geniuses. 
<br>
<br>I have only just discovered that swimming is also reincarnation.
<br>
<br>The fact is
<br>too many boyfriends here do nothing but expect,
<br>and I suspect 
<br>that the thing that they&#39;re all expecting is a new sense of self 
<br>enclosed in maudlin, brief letters 
<br>that are postmarked Los Angeles.
<br><br>

<u>England Poem</u>
<br>Something within my aura jerks, decelerates 
<br>like either a gyroscope or a sportscar so gradually 
<br>as England swaddles her entire citizenry in breaths
<br>of monarch butterflies and the welkin.
<br>
<br>Speed racers in a bereft country
<br>that dreams desserts, 
<br>not motorcycles.
<br><br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br><br>
<u>Love Poem</u>
<br>Is it having or being
<br>a vessel, an eye, which is a vessel,
<br>a germ, a crystal ball, 
<br>a medium? 
<br>
<br>I have been asking. Which is it?
<br><br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>

<u>Limerick</u>
<br>It is about time to decamp 
<br>from twilight on the ocean floor, 
<br>where, nine by nine, 
<br>my pampered flaws in cute formation bob and twirl. 
<br>
<br>Sunrise, 
<br>as it has often been stated, is without ruth 
<br>or sympathy, but I guess 
<br>afternoon and evening 
<br>shall hand out rectos of peace.
<br><br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
<br><br>
<u>Rage Poem</u>
<br>Everything in this sham village.
<br>I&#39;m silver with anger, 
<br>black with rage.
<br><br>
<span style = "color: aquamarine;">&#x273F</span>
