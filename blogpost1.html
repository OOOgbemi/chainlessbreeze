<dd>My thought-forms were transparent today I think &#x2639 I'm exhausted
<br>
However listening to Keith Jarrett the K&#246;ln concert as <span style = "color: lavender; text-shadow: 1px 1px gainsboro;">C</span> recommended, and I think it's working. Always very receptive to music right before bed. 
<br>
Watched horses, sheep, and sunset this evening. Right now, I still like the poems that I wrote yesterday. (must be careful not to treat this blog as a journal.)
<br>
I am reading the Plague by Camus. It's making me realize that I have not yet recovered (not even close). 
<br>
Thinking about V.W. lore & anger
<br>
Recently watched part of a documentary about coco Chanel. Arthur "Boy" Capel. Interesting to me that his books are still in her apartment
