<dd>Introducing <a href = "./TantrumHome.html"><span style = "color: black; text-shadow: 1px 1px red; font-family: 'Poiret One';">TANTRUM Poetry</span></a>, a guide, or game. A tool for writing poetry. Probably the best thing that we can do for ourselves as amateur poets is get offline immediately. But, barring that, use this tool, and then get offline:-)
<br>
It works - I'm serious - and I have put up evidence of its effectiveness in the form of a poem that I wrote this morning, called 'Sandstorm.' 
<br>
Although my poem might be pedestrian and stodgy, it makes poetic sense, and it felt good to write, which, when you consider what we're talking about, is a bit of miracle.
<br>
I'm beginning to think that feeling sorry for yourself is not an indication of despicable weakness, but instead a healthy starting point, or rather the only starting point. Wallowing -> great beauty pipeline. That is what <a href = "./TantrumHome.html"><span style = "color: black; text-shadow: 1px 1px red; font-family: 'Poiret One';">TANTRUM</span></a> is all about. That and bravado :-)
<br>
Also I think it's nice for us to see our anger in poetry and realize that our feelings are not going to destroy the world (if you know, you know).
