True Love, Pure Affection
</p>

<p> 
&emsp;<span style = "color:red;">S</span>he fantasized about her thirties - her thirtieth birthday party in particular - but her mother disapproved strongly of it. Everyone between their generations said that things improved exponentially after thirty, if you were a woman. But her mother fretted that young people didn&#39;t choose to dance at parties, but instead just stood around and drank, or took drugs and lay down on the floor.
<br>
&emsp;Doyin, who knew that to be both true and false, found that she didn&#39;t mind nineteen, however - not so much. If she were being honest, she felt that the pressure was off, a great deal of it. No one had yet climbed into her bedroom with a gun, saying he wanted to steal her soul.
<br>
&emsp;Having a boyfriend also helped, even if Gal thought that she deliberately chose men who were stupid, thereby putting herself in terrible danger. She liked the routine and the separation. He didn&#39;t care about her friends or want to know them. He actually didn&#39;t pay them any attention at all, which, though odd, she thought might actually be safer, in a way.
<br> 
&emsp;In truth, he didn&#39;t have the time. On the weekends, therefore, when she had herself to herself, she and Gal and Lucien went dancing Friday and Saturday like clockwork. Love was for weeknights. Love and learning. This despite the fact that he trained at six Monday to Thursday. 
He refused to sleep with her on weekends because he said that he had to recuperate after matches, every one of which she attended. So much the better. But she did like the sense of security, which even Gal could acknowledge as real. They used her room far more often than they used his.
<br>
&#x219F
<br>
&emsp;<span style = "color: blue;">S</span>he&#39;d cheated once and she thought that he had done the same, but she didn&#39;t hold it against him. She felt sure that he would hold it against her - that he would be irate - and yet the possibility of clearing the air was one she found very thrilling. 
<br>
&emsp;But she didn&#39;t need to ask Lucien to realize that it was utterly impossible. Lucien had been stalked thrice in her life. Once in her hometown, twice since coming to college. All exes. 
Perhaps in her mid-twenties with someone much more evolved. That would be part of it as well. Doyin loved growing up.
<br>
&#x219F
<br>
&emsp;<span style = "color: blue;">T</span>he thing that had happened when she was thirteen was this. Coming home from school, she had felt especially tired, but she had rushed in spite of that because she could tell that a storm was coming on, and she had no umbrella. Pink and blue clouds, gravely delineated, a stirring composition in the heavens. But the humidity felt frighteningly electric, and she panted in her uniform.
<br>
&emsp;She entered her building just as it started to thunder - relieved. Said hi to Thom, the doorman and waited, dizzy, for the elevator. Tore at her tie and hat inside, spread her collar, and then gazed at her disheveled self in the mirror. The flyaways around her braids were soaked with sweat.
<br>
&emsp;She nearly fainted in the long corridor that she&#39;d never liked because the brown carpet was stained, and there was always no one else in it. But she made it, managed to let herself into the apartment with her key, kick off her shoes. She took dragging steps in dotted socks up to the fridge. 
<br>
&emsp;Zeroing in on jasmine rice, which she heated in the microwave as the simplest thing and ate with butter just to get rid of her dizziness. Only then did she think to put down her bag pack. Bowl to dishwasher, wondering if she was going to fall ill.
<br>
&emsp;She took a glass of water to her bedroom and then decided that she would better enjoy her intended nap if she took a cold shower beforehand and got clean of all the sweat. 
<br>
&emsp;Showering in her own bathroom - the icy jet. Pleasant torture. Gasping and grinning like a nutter in the stream. And then to bed, not bothering with pajamas. A heavy sleep.
<br>
&emsp;She woke at nine in the tempest. Nine on the dot, with no lingering dreams. The room was cool and murky, her disorientation extreme. She heard movement and chatter. Her mother and someone else on speakerphone. An argument? Whose voice was that? It took her a few moments to realize that the strange man speaking so loudly was her older brother. 
<br>
&emsp;Thrusting her duvet away from her body, in an effort to shock herself into complete wakefulness. Blinking, yawning. Her faintness had not gone, but had lessened. Sitting up slowly and enjoying her stiffness. I&#39;m sick, she thought, not knowing whether or not it was true. She doubted that she would be able to do any homework, and so she advised herself that she had better come up with a good story for the next day. 
<br>
&emsp;As she dressed, a whim took her. She walked over to her window. It stood open, and the floor beneath it was all wet. She pushed it up further, and then leaned backward into the fire escape. The rain lashed her face and refreshed her marvelously. When she was back indoors, she stood still for a moment to enjoy its muffled clatter and the coolness that ran underneath her shirt. Then she wiped her face on her sleeve and went out to the living room.
<br>
&emsp;Her mother stood halfway inside the fridge. Her brother&#39;s tirade charged the air, with occasional loud, yet complaisant, interruptions from her mother, whose phone rested on the island. Neither sounded angry, and yet it was undoubtedly an argument. That was their customary way with each other. Doyin hardly noticed it. In fact, it was so familiar that it gave her a deep sense of security as she walked into the kitchen. 
<br>
&emsp;She came up to the island slowly and sat on one of three tall stools. As she did so, her mother turned with a Tupperware container in hand and looked her directly in the eye.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;If you didn&#39;t want me to object, then you shouldn&#39;t have told me,&#34; she told the phone. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t have.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She was still dressed in the clothes that she had worn to the office. These, too, gave primal comfort to her daughter. The needle stripes of her broadcloth shirt, which she owned in many a pastel shade. The swinging, wide-legged, black slacks (noticing these brought to Doyin&#39;s mind the sound of her syncopated gait, sponsored by the high heels). And the incongruously flashy, unfeminine watch, which was Doyin&#39;s favorite aspect. 
<br>
&emsp;Her mother set the Tupperware container down and wiped her fingers briskly on the fabric of her slacks. The container was frosted with snow from the freezer.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But can you accept that it was less <I>his choice</I> and more just a sign of the times?&#34; Her brother cried.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Bolu - Bolu - My taxi&#39;s here. Okay? &#8230;Yes. Yes, yes, I&#39;m on my way. I will call you when I arrive. Okay&#8230; Bye-bye.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She shook her head as she ended the call. This tiny gesture made Doyin incredibly uneasy. She suppressed the feeling and advised her mother of a fact that she was absolutely certain would capture her interest. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I slept for nearly six hours.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;But then the phone screeched again, and her mother picked it up and soothed it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Hm? Hello? I&#39;m sorry, Doyin. Sorry. <I>Hello?</I> Hello?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;This call was not made on speakerphone, which likely meant that it was work-related. Doyin watched her mother place the Tupperware container in the microwave to defrost, the phone between her ear and her shoulder. Then she moved to the living room and opened the sleek portfolio that she took with her to work. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes? Yes? &#8230;No, I had spoken to him once after New York. There was a strategy meeting. DBI. But I didn&#39;t refer to the survey results because I knew that he wasn&#39;t up to speed. He wasn&#39;t there for that presentation, and so I knew that&#8230; Right. It wouldn&#39;t have been generative.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She was rifling through the portfolio. Taking folders out and placing them in her handbag. She stood abruptly, fastening the handbag shut. Uncertainty lit up her face - or consternation. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I can call him, but that will have to be tomorrow. And actually I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;m the person&#8230; You understand me. Right, exactly.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;As Doyin watched, she went into the entryway and returned with a pair of sneakers. These, she put on deftly while sitting on an arm of the couch. Doyin, still feeling ill at ease, tuned out of the conversation until there was another mention of her brother.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes, I have to go and pick up my son at the airport. For spring break, yes. But then he&#39;ll be with his friends for most of it.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She laughed acidly. It remained unclear to Doyin whether her discomfort was physical, as in a sign of possible illness, or emotional because her mother was ignoring her. This confusion had been a structuring feature of her consciousness.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Thank you, Anna. No, thank you for keeping me in the loop. Okay. Good.&#34; Another laugh. &#34;Good, good&#8230; Alright - goodbye.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;The call was over. Doyin looked at her mother, who appeared to be worlds away, running through lists of priorities deep inside her mind and felt, again, a sense of profound security as well as a livid sense of vertigo while staring into these familiar, vacant eyes. The contradiction was a torment to her. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Okay - I&#39;m going. I have to pick up your brother. Have you eaten?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes. I had lunch.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Okay. Well, we will eat when I get back. I am <I>just</I> so hungry, you can&#39;t even imagine.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She took a baby banana from the fruit bowl when she passed the island to collect her keys. Doyin watched her hesitate by the door and glance around once more to make sure that she hadn't forgotten anything. It seemed to Doyin that she had never paid greater attention to any moment in her life. But what was she searching for? 
<br>
&emsp;Her mother muttered to herself.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;See you later.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Doyin said nothing. The door slammed shut.
<br>
&#x219F
<br>
&emsp;<span style = "color: blue;">D</span>oyin could hardly breathe in the brazen heat of the bleachers, and so it mystified her that Niyi managed to leap around the blazing court for two hours. Add to that that he was not a fleet-footed person - not a natural runner. Rather, his strengths were in his springiness and force. He was an unlikely tennis champion. With every point he gained, her relief made her stomach drop, with the result that she felt terribly nauseous in addition to feeling so weak. 
<br>
&emsp;Her heart pounded fearfully throughout each set, in spite of her secret conviction she didn&#39;t care whether or not he won. How many times had she said so to herself? And yet when it was over, she didn&#39;t think that she could stand. 
<br>
&emsp;She watched him shake the hand of his opponent grimly over the top of the net, both men standing unwittingly in froths of light. The sweat poured down from their scalps and temples; she could see it. 
<br>
&emsp;Then, less than half an hour later, she sagged against the victor as he spoke with the other players on his team, listening closely to the strange exactness that was peculiar to his speech. Her faintness prevented her from following the thread of their conversation, however. 
Niyi laughed with his coaches, and it unnerved her because he did it so rarely. And then he took her back to her dorm room, having realized that something was seriously wrong with her.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;It&#39;s because you never eat,&#34; He insisted, making her sit down on the edge of her pristine bed. &#34;It&#39;s just irresponsible.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I think I&#39;m going to throw up.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He gave her his water bottle and then vanished into her bathroom. She heard the sounds of the shower.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Niyi, I can&#39;t&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He reappeared. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Drink that - quickly.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She drank, following orders as she always did with him. She was horrified when he began to undress her, having committed herself from the very beginning to a need for absolute control as concerned her appearance, and especially her nude appearance, when it came to him. But she felt that there was no limit to her exhaustion except death - she literally could not move - and behind that a disconcerting curiosity. And she didn&#39;t want to cry, which she thought was what might happen if she opened her mouth to argue with him. 
<br>
&emsp;He helped her into the bathroom and made her sit on the shower floor, right underneath the glacial stream. He didn&#39;t stay, but left her alone there, and after no more than four or five minutes, she re-emerged in a towel to find him on her bed, scrolling his phone. 
<br>
&emsp;The pale blue of her striped sheets complimented both the whiteness of his clothes and the cool darkness of his skin. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Better?&#34; He asked.
<br>
&emsp;She would have done anything for him. But he said, &#34;I&#39;m very tired,&#34; and stood and hoisted his racket bag on his shoulder. &#34;See you on Monday. Eat something.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;And then he left. Following a four-hour nap, she rallied. He had left her his water bottle, and she sat up in bed and groaned and drank from it. Jazz tunes floated mystifyingly through the wall which adjoined the bedroom of her neighbor. Duke Ellington. And then her phone started to ring.
<br>
&emsp;It was Lucien, who was annoyed because she hadn&#39;t been responding to texts. Gal was with her. They were supposed to have met somewhere over half an hour prior. The three had plans to go to a party that evening, where a DJ of whom they had heard was going to perform a set. Lucien was driving - a car had been borrowed - it was out of town.
<br>
&emsp;Doyin ate all the walnuts in a bag of walnuts - one of many she had stashed under her bed for situations such as these - and quickly dressed herself in light blue mesh. She was smearing lip gloss over her eyelids when her phone began to ring again. She leapt toward it, but didn&#39;t answer the call, instead collecting her wallet from her bedside table and rushing from the room. 
<br>
&emsp;She applied her lipstick on the stairs and was surprised to find, when she emerged from her building, that night had fallen. Lucien and Gal honked from the end of the crescent. Doyin was so disturbed by the noise, by the prospect of the email that she expected to receive about it from some administrator or peer in the morning, that she didn&#39;t even remark the color of the car that she was entering. It was some kind of SUV. 
<br>
&emsp;As soon as she was in, the music started and went through her skin.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Where were you? &#8230;Do you want this?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;An indigo pill in the shape of a flying saucer sat in Lucien&#39;s palm. Doyin took it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I was sleeping.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;<I>Were</I> you? Poor baby.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Taste of vermouth. Gal was driving. She drove too fast. The music sort of galled her, in a good way. Doyin leaned forward between her friends, who sat in the front, but she didn&#39;t hear their conversation. Consciousness ballooned strangely within her. The purple pill. She was most aware of herself when they drove over the bridge, where there was a little traffic. 
<br>
&emsp;She looked ahead at the candy-lights of many cars on their lane, and the high beams streaking on the other side. She thought of the black water pulsing below somewhere and listened to her heartbeat. Something was happening.
<br>
&#x219F
<br>
&emsp;<span style = "color: blue;">A</span>t a quarter past eleven, Doyin was still wide awake. She had given a cursory attempt to her homework for the sake of her conscience. But her mind was full of cotton balls. Her mother and brother had not yet returned from the airport. 
<br>
&emsp;Since she was alone, and being alone at night still unnerved her, she played music quietly from her laptop while she surfed the Internet. She read about popstars and their psyches and found that she sympathized, which led her to a think-piece whose title attracted her, &#39;The Source of Fame,&#39; which linked, in its second paragraph, a video of a piano concerto from the nineties, which she clicked on but did not watch because she was then led, via the advertisement that preceded the video, to the product page for a pair of wireless earbuds in the shapes of berries, which reminded her of a pair of red sneakers that she wanted for Christmas, but wouldn&#39;t ask for because she felt that they were not a big enough ask. 
<br>
&emsp;Her life was all behind her eyes, and so she didn&#39;t hear the clanging on the fire escape at first, or rather she did, but thought that she&#39;d imagined it. Eric was inside before she noticed he was here - but when she did notice, she noticed all at once, with a wrenching shock. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What are you doing?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He was in costume, she realized. He wore a cape and some sort of black and gray unitard. A mask that would have covered only his eyes was pushed back to rest on the crown of his blond head. He blinked at her, looking frightened. But he was the one holding a gun. She had spotted it without recognizing what it was. But now, in retrospect, and without looking, she knew.
<br>
&emsp;Doyin realized that a laugh was expiring somewhere within her. A laugh inspired by the ridiculousness of the costume and of the situation. Who was Eric? He was in her class, but she did not know him well at all. One of his close friends was a person whom she disliked intensely. He was too online, full of theories, arrogant. A fair few of the boys were like that, but not all of them said openly that they hated girls and not all of them seemed so vicious.
<br>
&emsp;Eric hadn&#39;t moved, and he wasn&#39;t saying anything.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Eric?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She watched him take a deep breath then. She didn&#39;t want to speak again because she felt nauseous. Fear drew her down. She couldn&#39;t have moved. It was as though someone had filled her socks with cement. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Do you know why I&#39;m here?&#34; He mumbled.
<br>
&emsp;Doyin started to cry.
<br>
&#x219F
<br>
&emsp;<span style = "color: blue;">D</span>ancing. It had turned out to be a run-down house on a creepy street of run-down houses, which were tall, narrow, and spaced considerably far apart from one another. Lucien read the numbers aloud until they came to number six. They could hear the music throbbing from down in the basement. 
<br>
&emsp;No one had answered the door, of course, when they had knocked, but it was open, and so they had let themselves in. They were greeted by a brindled gray cat, who, sidling gradually down the staircase in the hall, had seemed at first to be either a ghost or a shadow. No lights were on, and they only spotted her by virtue of the sickly, white mist emitted by the nearest lamppost, which seemed to ooze through the sidelights. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; Gal said.
<br>
&emsp;Following the music, they passed the staircase and went down the narrow corridor that led to the kitchen, where there was another doorway, in which two tall, long-haired specters awaited them.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Tickets,&#34; one of them said.
<br>
&emsp;Doyin observed that they were identical, down to the cuts on the corners of their lips. Lucien used her phone to show them the tickets, which she had purchased weeks ago. They studied her screen for a long time, and Doyin wondered whether they would be turned away on the basis of their dress. They were very colorful tonight: herself in blue, Gal in lilac, and Lucien in her usual red and pink. Lucien looked particularly gorgeous - fresh-faced. Her beauty would get them in, and if not, then her arrogance. They were playing the filthy and textured music that she particularly liked dancing to.
