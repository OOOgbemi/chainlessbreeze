Landing, I woke from a decent dream, but I allowed it to slip from memory without regret. Instead, I was caught up in contemplation of the riches that lay ahead of me, now that I had survived another air journey. Teardrops oozed over my eyelids, brought on by tiredness and the astringent, greenish light of the airplane cabin. I fought to hide my fluctuating grin as we rumbled toward the luminous carcass of the airport. It was midnight.
<br>
Rumbling, I permitted myself to imagine the expression that she would wear when she first saw me: the bashful, gentle surprise that I would enjoy, knowing that I had transformed in the last two years - and for the better. But then it occurred to me that it might satisfy me just as much, or even more, if she didn’t seem in any degree surprised, the idea being that she knew me well enough to notice what was the same before she noticed what was different. That was what I felt, and it didn’t make any sense. 
<br>
Of course, I had craved recognition painfully since I had stopped being a child, which is not the same as becoming an adult, or even as having grown up. I craved the company of someone who really knew…but what on earth was there to know? It was a question that required not only an answer, but another person to speak it. 
<br>
I thought its answer would be whatever essential truth I myself had not yet had the courage to articulate about my life and character, the true pattern or vista of my psyche, of the spirit of which I was not aware except in the gel of the dream work, all things which I scarcely hoped to glimpse on my deathbed. The fantasy was of someone who already had the key of my personality and would consent to hide it from me and with me. It entailed devotion and oblivion and all sorts of other concepts that I had invented at seventeen and eighteen…
<br>
The way in which my muscles sang when I stood up to lift my bag out of the overhead cabin reminded me of the following fact: there is no actual boundary between the deliciousness of fatigue and the gradual ecstasy of rest. I coveted the ache, knowing whose pillows would rest my head later that night. The knowledge could almost have made up for everything, but then we have more than just ourselves to take care of: we have the self that we will be in a minute, in a day, and a fortnight. And in ten years…
Time seemed to pass so quickly and smoothly as I walked through the body of the plane, and then through that of the airport. They felt like the safest and merriest places in the world to me on that night - especially the arrivals hall with its unpleasant little sculptures, those inert, half-hearted offerings to progress that were grievously disrupted in their aesthetic mission by the proximities of so many ATMs and café chains. 
I felt amused about all of that for one minute - and then Nere. She didn’t smile, but I had forgotten my hopes already. She was there, and I may have been in love with her. And she didn’t look at all like herself. 
I approached her without necessarily wanting to, because I had realized subconsciously that something was very, very different. As I did, I studied all her clothes. It felt important, for some reason, to determine whether I recognized any part of her outfit. But it had been almost a year, and I didn’t. Her black pullover was too loose on her, but I liked the way in which it drooped around her hips and almost gaped at the collar. I clung to that because it was vaguely familiar. Everything else seemed strange, as though she had been ill.
“Hello.”
“Hello…”
I shuddered when she embraced me. She must have noticed. She felt as fragile as a cat. I had the most horrible urge to squeeze her, despite my impression that, if I did, I would shatter every one of her bones. Another fine line, because I desired her awfully, as usual, and had missed her so awfully as well. 
“What’s the matter?” 
Her black eyes gleamed as though filled with tears. It caused me terror - the idea that I might not be able to answer her - and so I forced myself to prevaricate.
“I’m just so tired. It’s good to see you.”
She held my hand. She was so warm, and I had difficulty deciding whether or not she was warmer than she should be. Initially, I hadn’t wanted to touch her, but now I found that I didn’t want to let her go. And, oddly, though we were the same height, I felt, for the first time in my memory, that I was looking down on her. But I wasn’t: our eyes were level.
“How was the flight? …Let me help.”
I couldn’t have let her carry my duffel bag then if my life depended on it.
“No, I’m fine.”
She looked at me and smiled a strangely wry smile, as though she knew. But knew what? Briefly, I felt the old, staggering surge of vivid feeling for which I had yearned and which was, to me, the meaning of pleasure. But here it was misplaced, and I tried to remind myself of that.
“How is the old panic doing?” 
She meant my fear of air travel. I dropped her hand and forced myself to draw her closer.
“It wasn’t too bad this time.”
And that was true. I had found that the fear was much more manageable when I felt joy or enthusiasm around the purpose of the journey. Something else was the same, I realized: her smell. I was really tired, and I could hardly stand the confusion that this caused. 
“Did you manage to read?” She asked.
“A little bit. Highsmith again. I can’t get away from her.”
“That’s because you’re her type. Which one?”
“The Tremor of Forgery.”
“I don’t think I’ve read that one!”
“It’s about a writer in Tunisia. Sort of hard-boiled. And funny.”
Her voice was the same as well. Or was it? I felt it thrumming through her body whenever she spoke - a good sensation. And then it thrummed through me, as though it were mine, because I was leaning against her. My blinks were heavy, and she noticed. 
“I shouldn’t be making you talk - look at you. You can barely stand.”
I yawned. 
Aware that I was mostly asleep and in fact already dreaming, I said, “You can do whatever you want with me.”
-
We bought train tickets at an uncanny anthropomorphic terminal, where I tried to observe her a little more closely. Whatever it was, the blue light coming off of the friendly screen made it much, much worse. But the familiar look of tranquil focus that she wore when completing even the most humiliatingly mundane tasks was there as well. Whatever I did, I would trust that look. I just couldn’t help it.
“The platform’s going to be freezing.” She murmured as she collected our printed tickets. 
“I have a coat. You don’t.”
She glanced over my outfit, narrowing her eyes. 
“Where’s your scarf?”
“Well, where’s your coat?”
She met my eyes and smiled into them with real amusement. “I don’t need one.”
“Don’t be a show-off.”
Smiling still, she shook her head and then turned away and began walking toward the escalators. I felt very confused. She was right - it was cold - and I detested the slow descent onto the gloomy, windy, desolate platform. Our train had not yet arrived. There were other tired travelers waiting there like ghosts, which in fact was what they were. They, like all of us, naturally had unfinished business that tethered them to the world. But these particular ghosts wore it on their faces and their clothes, which made their desperation seem especially galling. 
Many of them were in smart clothes that appeared neither truly warm nor truly comfortable. I disliked the sight of them in their dark, muted colors, as sleek as oil, or as browsers. Some carried very slim briefcases. All wore what, that year, was considered tasteful jewelry. 
Nere and I sat down on one of those icy iron benches that hurt simply to set eyes on and that are often found in train stations. It was painted a glossy, unlovely green. I shivered violently. My sleepy body would not remain rigid. Nere looked at me and then made me put my hands into the spacious sleeves of her sweater. Wonderingly, I thawed the backs of my fingers against her burning forearms. She didn’t even seem to feel it. Overwrought for no reason but my tiredness, I slumped against her, trying to suppress what felt like rising laughter, but could just as easily have been big, anxious tears. The collar of the white t-shirt that she wore underneath the sweater tickled the tip of my nose until I sneezed, and then I snickered. 
She kissed the top of my head, and I had to resist the urge to look at her and make sure it was she who had done it. 
“It’d be so bad if you got sick,” She said.
“I haven’t been sick in years,” I bragged.
She was hot, and she was also tingling, in a way. Or humming, like a computer. What frightened me was the way in which I could feel myself ricocheting from primal wariness to a deep-rooted, depthless, and soothing desire. The latter emotion, I knew both from experience and from something deeper, could not be plumbed; it was fed by its own fulfillment, neverending. As long as things on earth had their natures, that emotion had me - more on a cellular than on a psychic level. That was the way I thought of it. 
The arrival of our train was a profound joy to me, as though on some inarticulate level I had despaired of ever escaping from the airport. A jagged resurgence of energy made me stride quickly through the blue, brightly-lit carriages, leading Nere, until we found one that was empty but for two. There, we sat. The train would have us in the middle of the city in less than half an hour. I looked forward to the sensation of its speed, which I knew would probably plug me straight into a light, but sensuous and poignant sleep. Nere was quiet beside me. The doors hissed shut.
“I missed you,” I complained in a whisper.
She snarled, “I know you did.”
