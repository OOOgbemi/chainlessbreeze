&emsp;I was right about one thing, which even Ladi could acknowledge was true&#58; true love is everywhere. It&#39;s in the air that we breathe&#59; it is dishearteningly commonplace. It had taken him a long time to acknowledge it, due to electrifying experiences with hot chicks who had made him feel seen and heard when he was basically a kid. But nobody can confer unto any one of us the status that we deserve and require as <I>whole</I> and <I>human</I>&#59; no one is nearly exceptional enough to do it. It has to come from your own deeds, and even then, you are the only person who will ever really know.
<br>
&emsp;Still, it was very sporting of him to let me crash. He had found a true burrow, and it had thrown me for a loop at first&#59; I hadn&#39;t considered that Ladi was so clever - or, rather, so adaptable. There was even a certain appeal to the neighborhood, though it put me somewhat in mind of a refugee camp. The houses there felt flimsy, transitory, and new - but they were safe.
<br>
&emsp;I felt particularly safe there because I considered that I must be like a mythical creature, to the kinds of people who would willingly call such a neighborhood home. The truth was that I may as well have been wearing the most elaborate camouflage; they didn't see me at all. They would never guess what I had done.
&emsp;Curiously, I even felt that Ladi himself was blind to it, though I had as much as confessed it to him. Anyway, he knew - but he didn&#39;t seem to me really to have taken it in because he went to work every evening at seven as though everything were normal. 
<br>
&emsp;He was the night guard in a nearby oil refinery, and he was paid suitably well for that. (He hasn&#39;t told me how suitably, but he owns his house&#58; a two bedroom bungalow in a farming village forty minutes from where he works.) Ladi and I studied English together in college, but he has been more creative with his degree. I first became a writer, and then a murderer. He became a homeowner, a member of a residents&#39; association, a guardian of the interests of fossil fuel companies - someone who was, presumably, willing to lay down his life to forestall hooliganism at the plant. Someone who never dwelled on the news, though he kept up with it. In short, an upstanding citizen of his country. 
<br>
&emsp;I, on the other hand, had brooded morbidly over the grisliest of current events in the seven months leading up to my crime, in which context, what I did had made total sense. 

</p>

<div class = "backboard2">

&emsp;Poor Ladi loves it at the plant; that&#39;s the strange thing. I really sense that he is telling me the truth when he says so. After his work, we sit together on his deck, facing a garden that he doesn&#39;t have the slightest idea what to do with, drinking the hoppy Swedish pilsner that he likes and keeps numerous cans of in the fridge. He has some lavender shrubs among his wildflowers, and black bees languish over them even in the evening, and their fragrance is piteously beautiful. 
<br>
&emsp;We sit out until the sun has set behind us, and then, in the coolness of the teal night, we both begin to shoot the breeze. He tells me about his coworkers, whom he likes and has found surprisingly tolerant, and about the contretemps of union meetings. We never address the past. I speak to him about my recently completed dissertation - completed in the nick of time. We talk about philosophers he barely remembers.
<br>
&emsp;Potentially part of the reason why he doesn&#39;t remember is that he is seeing a woman casually in town - but he is reticent on the subject of this liaison. Naturally, I have not had the honor of meeting her. From the lengths of Ladi&#39;s silences, I have deduced that he and she don&#39;t have much to talk about, but that he is, as usual, sexually and spiritually entrammelled. When we were in college, he was frightened of women, and as a result, they always bested him - however, finding that he liked that, he has allowed it to continue. 
<br>
&emsp;In three and a half weeks, Ladi has never once quizzed me about the whys and wherefores of my disgrace, and it amuses me to think that he has written it off as a &#39;crime of passion.&#39; He has a quaint mind; I&#39;d say he&#39;s capable of it. But, if I have learned anything at all in my short life, it&#39;s that there are no crimes of passion, or rather, no passionate murder. Murder is always glacial, passionless, and icky.
<br>
&emsp;Good old Ladi has, however, inquired tactfully about my life online. I suspect he wants to know whether or not I thought I was in a video game. He is a good friend&#59; maybe he wants to suggest it as an angle for my attorney.
<br>
&emsp;I don&#39;t currently have an attorney, but, clearly, I am not opposed to getting caught. Ladi will have to lie and claim that he didn&#39;t suspect me. I have explained to him that I just need a break before my life comes to a close.

&emsp;It will seem trite if now I begin to wax poetic about how these weeks - my time at large - have been my first taste of liberty ever. Anyone, I am sure, who is reading this, knows that we all begin life in imprisonment. 
<br>
&emsp;Not all of us end it there, but certainly we all end it conditioned. I am not sure that there is any way effectively to undo that conditioning. I made my attempt, and I will admit that it failed. And yet this month - these days of surrender - have stood out from the rest of my life in the sense that they have seemed sovereign.
<br> 
&emsp;For one thing, I have become more observant, which, ironically, has led me straight to the experiences of integration that I sought for years and years and years fruitlessly. There is a little wood not very far from Ladi&#39;s house, and on the borders of it are pear trees. The windfall from those trees, as it rots, attracts red admirals. Every morning, while taking the day&#39;s first walk, I forget that they are there, and every morning, I surprise them and myself by causing an explosion of red and black wings. A carmine flurry, which seems to dissolve in the milk of morning sunlight, before I see where the insects have settled on plush leaves.
<br>
&emsp;I can see everything about these butterflies, including the tumescences on the undersides of their satin wings and their limber antennae. I compare them to memories that I have of butterflies on video or of specimens pinned to boards in museums of natural history. But there are tones and pitches to the arches of their flight that I never knew. 
<br>
&emsp;And then I&#39;ve come to realize that the night is my friend and that silver is not one, but countless colors. My favorite walks have been all those that I have taken in the dark&#8230; I prefer to walk close to the wood, with the sighing gloom on one side of me. Ladi&#39;s neighborhood is so remote that, if not for the moon, the darkness of night would be total. It is not remotely difficult to imagine fairies living among the trees; when I'm out there, I can almost hear their mirthful whispers. 
<br>
&emsp;And nothing in the world is more splendid, more tantalizing than, in such blackness, a mist of argent brilliance sagging from the sky. I see the everything in everything these days, which statement would seem like complete and utter nonsense to Ladi, in this surprisingly square chapter of his life. But I don&#39;t feel the need, as I suppose I used to do once, to express such musings to others. 
<br>
&emsp;I have learned an important lesson, here on the rim of civilization, which is that everything that happens in this world happens inwardly.

&emsp;I finally met Ladi&#39;s woman in my third weekend on the lam, and I saw at once what the situation was with her. She was as lustrous as a magazine, fresh as something digital, but in dreary colors and clothes not in her size. Other than a strange, cobalt scarf that was tucked partway into the collar of her pullover, she was all in pavement gray. 
<br>
&emsp;When you spoke to her, she looked slightly off to the side and frowned a bit, as though thinking. But somehow you doubted that her thoughts had anything to do with what you said. And when <I>she</I> spoke to <I>you</I>, she looked right into your eyes with her own dark brown, candid, accusing ones. All you wanted to do was bite her guiltless lips, and so I was a little less hard on Ladi after that. 
<br>
&emsp;She surprised us, having driven all the way over one evening on impulse, to please him and herself. This thoughtfulness threw Ladi into a state of confusion, therefore I was the one who arranged us around the kitchen table and got us drinks and explained that I was visiting my friend. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You&#39;ve known one another for quite a while,&#34; She said in a tone of jealousy that delighted and surprised me.
<br>
&emsp;I smiled.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you do now?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;m in graduate school.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And what is <I>that</I> like?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Really dull.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She tensed at my glibness.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do <I>you</I> do?&#34; I asked.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I work in an antique store&#8230; But I want to open my own shop, selling second-hand clothes, one day&#8230; I collect vintage pieces.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She unwrapped the thing that was tied around her neck and handed it to me. I saw that it was a beautiful and unusual sort of muff with satin ties - silky on one side and velveteen on the reverse - in a shade of muffled, gorgeous blue. It had a scent, from her, like lilies of the valley.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Beautiful,&#34; I said, meaning it.
<br>
&emsp;I thought that my compliment seemed to gratify her. For one or two reasons, I then decided that it would be circumspect to leave them alone. I stood and said that I was going for a walk. Ladi had hardly uttered a word since her arrival, and I speculated that this episode could mean the end of my asylum with him. 
<br>
&emsp;Still, I was entirely unconcerned as I wandered out into the chill pink of early evening. Birds with sharp, syrupy calls that I couldn&#39;t identify murmurated above the trees. I thought about our university days, and in particular about the reality of innocence. In retrospect, it seemed marvelous, the way that Ladi and some of our other friends had coasted above their disillusionment, surfed it, and landed safely on the shore of &#39;the real world.&#39;
