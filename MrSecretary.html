&emsp;I was right about one thing, which even Ladi could acknowledge was true&#58; true love is everywhere. It is in the air that we breathe&#59; it is dishearteningly commonplace. It had taken him a very long time to come to it, due to electrifying experiences with hot chicks who had made him feel seen and heard when he was younger. But there is no one on this planet who can confer unto any of us the status that we crave and require as <I>whole</I> and <I>human</I>&#59; no one is nearly exceptional enough to do it. 
<br>
It has to come from your own deeds, and even then, you are the only person who will ever really know. Still, it was sporting of Ladi to let me crash. He had found a true burrow, and it stunned me a little at first&#59; I hadn&#39;t considered Ladi so clever - or, rather, so adaptable. And there was an appeal to the neighborhood, even though it put me somewhat in mind of a refugee camp. The houses there felt flimsy, transitory, and new - but they were safe.
<br>
I felt particularly safe there because I considered that I must be like a mythical creature to the kinds of people who would call such a neighborhood home. The truth was that I may as well have been wearing the most elaborate camouflage&#59; they didn&#39;t see me at all. They would never guess what I had done.
<br>
What was even more curious was that I even felt that Ladi himself was blind to it, though I had as much as confessed it to him. Anyway, he knew - but he didn’t seem to me really to have taken it in because he went to work every evening at seven as though everything were normal. 
<br>
He was the night guard in a nearby oil refinery, and he was paid suitably well for that. (He hasn’t told me how suitably, but he owns his house: a two bedroom bungalow in a farming village forty minutes from where he works.) Ladi and I studied English together in college, but he has been more creative with his degree. I first became a writer, and then a murderer. He became a homeowner, a member of a residents’ association, a guardian of the interests of fossil fuel companies - someone who was, presumably, willing to lay down his life to forestall hooliganism at the plant. Someone who never dwelled on the news, though he kept up with it. In short, an upstanding citizen of his country. 
<br>
I, on the other hand, had brooded morbidly over the most grisly current events in the seven months leading up to my crime, in which context, what I did had made complete sense. 
<br>
&#x2661 &#x2665
<br>
Poor Ladi loves it at the plant; that&#39;s the strange thing. I really sense that he is telling me the truth when he says so. After his work, we sit together on his deck, facing a garden that he doesn’t have the first idea what to do with, drinking the hopsish Swedish pilsner that he likes and keeps numerous cans of in the fridge. He has some lavender shrubs among his wildflowers, and black bees languish over them even in the evening. Their fragrance is piteously beautiful. 
<br>
&emsp;We sit out until the sun has set behind us, and then, in the coolness of the teal night, we begin to shoot the breeze. He tells me about his coworkers, whom he likes and has found surprisingly tolerant, and about the contretemps of union meetings. We never address the past. He sees a woman casually, who lives in town, but he is reticent on the subject of this liaison. Naturally, I haven&#39;t had the privilege of meeting her. From the lengths of Ladi&#39;s silences, however, I have deduced that he and she don’t have much to talk about, but that he is sexually and spiritually entrammelled. 
<br>
&emsp;(When we were in school, Ladi was always frightened by women, and as a result, they often overbore him, but then, finding that he greatly enjoyed that, he has allowed it to continue.) 
<br>
&emsp;In three and a half weeks, Ladi has never once quizzed me about the whys and wherefores of my disgrace, and it amuses me to think that he has written it off as a &#39;crime of passion.&#39; He has a quaint mind&#59; I&#39;d say that he is capable of it. But, if I have learned anything at all, it&#39;s that there are no crimes of passion, or rather, no passionate murder. Murder is always glacial, passionless, and icky.
<br>
&emsp;He has, however, probed me tactfully about my life online. I suspect he wants to know whether or not I thought I was in a video game. He is a good friend&#59; perhaps he wants to suggest it as an angle for my lawyers.
<br>
&emsp;I don&#39;t currently have a lawyer, but, clearly, I am not opposed to getting caught. Ladi will have to lie and say he didn&#39;t suspect me. I have explained to him that I need a break before my life comes to a close.

<div class = "backboard2">

&emsp;It will seem trite if now I begin to wax poetic about how these weeks - my time at large - have been my very first taste of freedom since my birth. Anyone, I am sure, who is reading this, knows that we begin life in imprisonment. Not all of us end it there, but certainly we all end it conditioned. 
<br>
&emsp;I am not sure that there is any way effectively to undo that conditioning. I made my attempt and can admit that it has failed. And yet this month - these days of surrender - have stood out from the rest of my life and have seemed sovereign. 
<br>
&emsp;For one thing, I have become much more observant, which, ironically, has led straight to the experiences of integration that I sought for years and years and years fruitlessly. There is a little wood not very far from Ladi&#39;s house, and on the borders of it are pear trees. The windfall from those trees, as it rots, attracts red admirals. Every day, while taking the morning&#39;s first walk, I forget that they are there, and every day, I surprise both them and myself by causing an explosion of red and black wings. A carmine flurry, which seems to dissolve in the milk of morning sunlight, before I see where the insects have settled on plush leaves.
<br>
&emsp;I can see everything about these butterflies, including the tumescences on the undersides of their satin wings and their limber antennae. I compare them to memories that I have of butterflies on video or of specimens pinned to boards in museums of natural history. But there are tones and pitches to the arches of their flight that I never knew. 
<br>
&emsp;And then I&#39;ve come to realize that the night is my friend and that silver is not one, but countless colors. My very favorite walks have been those that I have taken in the dark. I like to walk near to the wood, with the sighing gloam on one side of me. 
<br>
&emsp;Ladi&#39;s neighborhood is so remote that, if not for the moon, the darkness would be total. It is not difficult to imagine fairies living among those trees; I can almost hear their mirthful whispers. And nothing in the world is more splendid, more tantalizing than, in such blackness, a mist of argent brilliance sagging from the sky. 
<br>
&emsp;I see the everything in everything these days, which statement would seem like complete and utter nonsense to Ladi, in this square chapter of his life. But I don&#39;t feel the need, as I used to do once, to express such things to other people. I have learned an important lesson, here on the rim of civilization, which is that everything that happens in this world happens inwardly.
<br>
&#x2661 &#x2665
<br>
&emsp;I finally met Ladi&#39;s woman in my third weekend on the lam, and I saw at once what the entire deal was with her. She was like something on a screen, but in dreary colors and clothes not in her size, which, however, were the precise fashion at that time. Other than a strange, cobalt scarf that was tucked partway into the collar of her pullover, she was all in shades of gray. 
<br>
&emsp;When you spoke to her, she looked slightly off to the side and frowned a bit, as though thinking. But somehow you doubted that her thoughts had anything to do with what you said. And when <I>she</I> spoke to <I>you</I>, she looked directly into your eyes with her own dark brown, candid, accusing ones. All you wanted to do was bite her guiltless lips, and so I was a little less hard on Ladi after that. 
<br>
&emsp;She surprised us, having driven all the way over one evening on impulse, to please him and herself. This thoughtfulness threw Ladi into a state of confusion, therefore I was the one who arranged us around the kitchen table and got us drinks and explained that I was visiting my friend. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You&#39;ve known one another for quite a while,&#34; She said in a tone of jealousy that delighted and surprised me.
<br>
&emsp;I smiled.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you do now?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;m in graduate school.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And what is <I>that</I> like?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Really <I>dull</I>.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She tensed at my glibness.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you do?&#34; I asked.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I work in an antique store&#8230; But I want to open my own shop, selling second-hand clothes, one day&#8230; I collect vintage pieces.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She unwrapped the thing that was tied around her neck and handed it to me. I saw that it was a beautiful and unusual sort of muff with satin ties - silky on one side and velveteen on the reverse - in a shade of muffled, gorgeous blue. It had a scent, from her, like lilies of the valley.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Beautiful,&#34; I said, meaning it.
<br>
&emsp;I thought that my compliment seemed to gratify her. For one or two reasons, I then decided that it would be circumspect to leave them alone. I stood and said that I was going for a walk. Ladi had hardly uttered a word since her arrival, and I speculated that this episode could mean the end of my asylum with him. 
<br>
&emsp;Still, I was unconcerned as I wandered out into the chill pink of early evening. Birds with sharp, syrupy calls that I couldn&#39;t identify murmurated above the trees. I thought about our university days, and particularly about the reality of innocence. In retrospect, it seemed marvelous, the way that he and some of our other friends had coasted above their disillusionment, surfed it, and landed safely on the shore of &#39;the real world.&#39; 
<br>

<div class = "backboard3">
&emsp;I had to go, and so I went. It did buoy me strangely to reencounter the familiar style and atmosphere of bus stations and of the bus, which was suffused with electric green light when it hissed to a stop before me at three o&#39;clock in the morning, which is of course the decisive hour, the devil&#39;s hour - the hour when the afflicted either triumph or pass away. Sitting there on the upper deck without an identity, rocking through space, through what actually seemed to be outer space at that time of night, alongside those I thought of as other species of renegade, or perhaps, by some twist of fate, the same species. 
<br>
&emsp;We were offloaded on the east coast, where I have always liked to be. My plan then was to take the earliest ferry to the island of H— and sleep on the beach until either I ran out of money or was caught. On a bench outside of the bus station, which was not five minutes away from the port, I waited for the sun to rise, sleepy, savoring the salt air. 
<br>
&emsp;Ladi had not asked me to leave, but, as his friend, I had understood. Nor did I blame Roxane because I still believe that, if anything, she liked me as well. It is a source of infinite fascination to me: how solitary is in the work of survival. She would have understood that, I am sure, and the whim did strike me, on the afternoon when I left Ladi&#39;s, to go and see her on my own, though I ignored it. 
<br>
&emsp;I didn&#39;t know where she lived, but I felt it would be nothing, in such a small town, to find her workplace - the antique shop. And I also felt sure that she would know exactly why I had come. My instincts are reliable, when it comes to that sort of thing. And so we would have gone together back to her apartment - not speaking because anyone could see that Roxane disliked speech. And she would have betrayed Ladi easily, almost dutifully, willing herself to believe that I had some power over her that I hadn&#39;t. Women like Roxane love to capitulate; that’s the only thing that they know how to do, and they don’t want it any other way. 
<br>
&emsp;However, for me, it would not have constituted a betrayal because Ladi and I are never going to see one another again. It was the end. Others might say that because I had liked her and had wanted to know her secrets, it also could not constitute a betrayal, for life is about pleasure. And, specifically, I had wanted to know the ones that she didn&#39;t know she was keeping, for those are the ones that we store in our bodies. And Roxane much preferred being touched than being spoken to - any idiot could have seen that. 
<br>
&emsp;But the window had passed, and I saw now that my chances were severely limited. In fact, what I saw, curiously, as I sat in the cool, colorless pre-dawn haze outside of the bus station, was the final chapter of my life outspread before me, in the shape of an alluvial cone - and I was headed into the gorge. 
<br>
&#x2661 &#x2665
<br>
&emsp;I swam in the ocean morning, noon, and night. Swimming was an unexpected pleasure - I hadn&#39;t given much thought to what I would do on the island, but then, sitting before the pleading waves, whether the sky was white or blue or black, it was always obvious.
<br>
&emsp;The season was over, and the holiday makers were gone, for the most part. It was late September, and the warm weather lingered, without even the bite of autumn, only the steadily intensifying ennui of late summer. It might have become a dangerous atmosphere for someone like me, were I among people. That sort of stasis in the climate is terrible, especially when one is close to the ocean, which, though it never ceases to change, is never transformed. But I remained in isolation, or rather in exile, and I kept to the northern point of the island, where there were few houses, none of them mansions, vast, sandy, picturesque meadows with purple flowers, and lonely, unremarkable beaches, which, I knew, with colder weather, would soon be visited by bobs of seals. 
<br>
&emsp;My only acquaintance was a person as unaccountable as myself, though this person wasn&#39;t on the run - which made his sinuous personality seem still odder. He lived on the island - Pasha was his name - but he was not a native islander. He was employed in a café called Café Lune on the main harbor - the most cobblestoned, shingled, and photographed portion of the island. I first encountered him under a blue awning, blocking the doorway to the establishment, smoking a cigarette at me.

</div>


<div class = "backboard4">
&emsp;We stared at one another&#59; I thought that he would send me away.
&emsp;&#34;Where do you come from?&#34; He asked outright, turning ever so slightly to make way for me.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I came last week, on the ferry,&#34; I said evasively. &#34;Can I sit where I like?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He nodded curtly and followed me to my table, which was in a corner by the wide window.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No more hot food,&#34; He pronounced, once I was seated.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But it&#39;s only two,&#34; I said, though I hadn&#39;t intended to order anything hot. 
<br>
&emsp;Pasha shrugged. I took note for the first time of his vaguely nautical attire: his striped shirt - white with black stripes - and the red bandana that was tied jauntily around his neck. His hair was also black and curly, but his skin was very pale. There was a certain coolness to his pallor which suggested that he might not be white. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ll just have a coffee then. An espresso. And a glass of milk on the side - a very cold one.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What are you doing here?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;I blinked at him.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;m sorry?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He gave me a look that said he saw through me, which of course was impossible. However, my sense was that I could not very well call his bluff if he was presently calling mine. There was a way in which it might work in the short run, but in the end it would put us both on much shakier ground by displacing us from the realm of simple language and depositing us in that of power-plays. Given what I had to hide, I could not risk moving in that direction. The best path would be to make him believe that I had yielded to his astuteness. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;m sort of taking a break from myself.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He smiled a smile of immense gaiety and charm. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes,&#34; he said simply. 
<br>
&emsp;Once he had brought my coffee and milk, he surprised me by pulling out the chair opposite to mine and joining me. He had a great deal that he had evidently wanted to share with someone who he&#39;d determined was like him. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I came here twelve years ago to take a break from myself, as you put it.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;How old were you then?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I was twelve years old.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Do you mean, you came here on your own?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Of course. Do you think they would have helped me? I came to live with my uncle.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Not knowing what to say, I asked, &#34;What does your uncle do?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;He doesn&#39;t do anything now; he’s dead. He was very ill. But in those days he was an astrologer - and a medium.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;A medium?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes. He didn&#39;t pull cards or use the board or anything like that. I&#39;m saying he was a medium in the most essential sense of the word - <I>you</I> know.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;I felt apprehensive and despised it in myself.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No, I don&#39;t,&#34; I muttered.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I mean that he saw guilt and the reasons for it.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Considering that, of guilt, I had none (at least not for the specific act that constituted my crime), this proclamation should not have alarmed me. But anything unconfessed, as I saw dimly then and understand more fully now, is maddening, and I could not help speculating that this oddball was winking at me from a place of weird, occult knowledge. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And that was how he made his living?&#34; Was what I asked.
<br>
&emsp;The boy smirked. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;The people on this island are enlightened, compared to those of other places. They enjoy getting to the root of things. Or, if not that, then they have a mania for it.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And,&#34; I hesitated. &#34;What does that lead to - getting to the root of things?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;It leads to what I said - enlightenment. Literally a sensation of lightness, of greater space, which allows true knowledge to flow up into consciousness more easily and creates room for clear perception.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Even after this, I could not be sure whether or not I was listening to a hack.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And so they paid him to do what, exactly?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;My flippancy earned me a heavy glare.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;They paid him for the opportunity to confess. To be brought into a state of readiness to face what they had done. Or what they thought they had done - memory is funny.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Interesting line of work.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Though I had spoken with aplomb, I was quaking in my boots. It was his gravity that frightened me. What he was saying seemed on the surface to be ridiculous, but a little thought showed that that was only due to the context and to his own slightly bizarre manner and appearance. I paid close attention to his words and realized that Pasha in truth was talking perfect sense and that he knew it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Indeed. That&#39;s right. And he passed it on to me.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;I realized with some alarm that I had been expecting such an announcement. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And so you do the same thing for people here&#8230;today?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I said the people on this island are enlightened, but I should have said that they <I>were</I>enlightened. There is no longer much appreciation for the art&#8230; The world is swimming with oracles, these days - our phones can tell us everything that we could ever want to know about our pasts and our futures. I have only a couple of clients.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He shrugged and grinned his melancholy. I scrutinized him for a sign of disharmony, of falseness.
&#34;You should be proud of yourself for lifting the torch.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Pride! You don&#39;t know me, or you&#39;d know that I have enough of it. Even too much.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;There it is, I thought. People who are proud never admit it - not in that way, to a stranger. But Pasha stood and pushed in his chair, fishing his packet of cigarettes from his back pocket.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Excuse me,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve got to go and frighten off more of the likes of you.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;With a cigarette already in his mouth, he smiled and winked at me. And then he went back to the entrance to face the street, leaning against the door jamb.  Meanwhile, I drank my milk and thought.
<br>
&emsp;Other than Pasha, I don&#39;t believe that I can have exchanged more than five words with any other person on the island - all whilst buying food and razors and new clothing with the last of my cash. 
No one, fortunately, has seemed to be much interested in me or the reasons for my appearance here. 
<br>
&emsp;I have wondered whether my lack of guilt - my psychic spurning of the function of the medium - could be another statement about our age. I feel absolutely no need - no need whatsoever - to put myself in a story.
