<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>T</b></span>hey wouldn’t come to earth that was not very well-turned and warm. Pin stalked the perimeter of her camp gradually and made sure that the soil there all appeared a darkish blue. She had her scuffle hoe with her, and she had put on her hat, though there was no need today - simply because seven months ago Salem had asked her to indirectly. 
<br>
&emsp;If memory served, what he had said was that weather could come on all of a sudden, and that it was no good to stand under two suns all morning and afternoon. How Salem knew that, Pin couldn’t tell, for there was said to be no weather, where he was from. 
<br>
&emsp;Standing under two suns all day was what she had been doing without remarking it ever since she was a child. Salem had given her this advice in the presence of Century, on the final day of their last Concord Visit, and, in the seven months since then, Pin had neither seen nor spoken to another of her kind.
<br>
&emsp;She was beginning to think that that was what was meant by concord. That is, her solitude. She was not in exile, for she hadn’t committed any crime. She wasn’t technically companionless, and so her isolation was not cruel. It couldn’t be conceived as any kind of punishment, in short. But she did have a sense almost of guilt - or something like it very foreign that had settled in her chest and spoke into her in clear, true tones. 
<br>
&emsp;Pin was sound; she liked herself and knew what she was good for, which was stewarding the few leapers in this region. And, though she could not consider herself to be spiritual to any degree, she had long decided to make an offering of her capabilities to the land - or to the world. However, in recent months, the new notion had visited her that it would be reckless not, before such a commitment, to see some life - to see what lay on the other side of it. 
<br>
&emsp;This idea had impressed her first by its difference from her other thoughts, and second by what appeared in retrospect to be the suddenness of its conception. She might say it had a different texture - a finer or a rougher grain - than her other ideas. On numerous occasions, she had even remarked to herself that she must have read it in a novel, though that would have been extremely unlikely, given that she hadn’t read fiction since she was a child - since her parents had taught her.
<br>
&emsp;Guilt was involved because what spirit Pin possessed was implicated in the new notion. It seemed a moral obligation, to see some life - or an article of faith. She didn’t have any idea how she would effect it, or of what, realistically, it could look like. But then again, as faith, it didn’t truly demand such knowledge. Rather than politting, stewing, or mounting what anyone could have viewed as an effort, therefore, Pin lived in her routine exactly as she had always done - waiting for the leapers, whom she knew individually by sight, looking them over, riding them sometimes illegally, updating the record of their breeding patterns, and taking care of their various illnesses and ailments. 
<br>
&emsp;Meanwhile, she extended what she thought of as her willpower, silently and in private, toward a few objects that had become, for her, the symbols and icons of the Great World. Salem and Century were two of these - Salem perhaps more so. She was shy when he crossed her mind; he glittered there like an opal. She had once seen an opal in a ring…
<br>
&emsp;The truth, as she framed it to herself, on those rare occasions when she could bring herself to face the thought of him, was that Salem was both of and from that shining city where people thronged and played with fire - planets away. The city of Io. 
<br>
&emsp;She felt she could tell from the way in which he dressed and moved, though she had never been to Io except in her clouded imagination, that he had derived all of his mannerisms from that place. He had been born there, she was sure, though she had never asked. In all of their sporadic meetings over the course of the last five years, she must have asked him no more than three or four questions that were not of an impersonal nature. 
<br>
&emsp;But she was observant, and she’d paid him a great deal of attention. He had strains of irony and languor in his character. Pin took irony, vaguely, to be a form of decadence and a part of Io culture. She didn’t understand all of his jokes. He dressed in colors like white, yellow, and silver. 
<br>
&emsp;His arrivals were the greatest disturbances that she ever faced, other than the deaths of leapers and his departures. He caused her amusement, chagrin, and great anxiety. But she liked him, and she liked the way he dressed.
