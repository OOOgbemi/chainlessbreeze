<span style = "text-align: center; font-family: 'Nanum Myeongjo'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>~TWIN FLAME 6 TAILS~</b></span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>L</b></span>eapers would not loiter in soil that was not exceedingly well-turned and warm, and, as such, Pin stalked the entire perimeter of her little encampment, sedately ensuring that every inch of the loam there appeared an inviting grayish-blue. She had a miniature scuffle hoe with her, and she also sported her smart visor, though there was no real need for it, simply because seven months ago Salem had asked her to do so, albeit indirectly. 
<br>
&emsp;If memory served, what he had actually said was that weather could come on quite suddenly and that it was, in his view, <q>no good</q> to stand under two suns throughout the mornings and afternoons, even on cool days. How Salem could be cognizant of all of that, Pin couldn&#39;t tell, for there was said to be no weather to speak of, where he was from. And - what was more - standing under two suns from morning until night was what she had been doing without fuss or compunction since she was a girl. Both of her parents had worked with the leapers as well. There was a sense in which they had also been conservationists.
<br>
&emsp;Salem had given her this unnecessary advice in the presence of Century on the final day of their most recent concord visit while beaming sunnily at her, and in the six months since that time, Pin had indeed neither seen nor spoken to another of her species. She had sent emails to Century, but Century didn&#39;t generally respond to her emails; that, as she understood it, was not in his purview. But Pin was beginning to think that this was precisely what was meant by concord. That is, her solitude.
<br> 
&emsp;She was not in exile, for certainly she was not guilty of any crime. Nor was she technically without companions, and so her isolation could not truthfully be characterized as cruel. Moreover, Pin&#39;s heart had chosen this path for her; she had coveted her current position for nearly a decade before assuming it. And yet! And yet she did truly have a sense of grievance or of something like it that felt both foreign and belittling. Whatever it was, it had contrived to nestle itself in her rib cage, and, often, from there, it seemed to speak into her core in clear, true tones&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Pin had been advised both by Century and by his predecessor that she was <q>sound,</q> and the truth was that, privately, she believed them. She felt that she knew what exactly it was that she was good for, which was to minister to and to steward the few leapers that survived in this region. And, though she could not consider herself to be in any degree spiritual, she had long decided to make an offering of her capabilities to the land, such as they were - or to the cosmos. And at the same time, in recent months, the new notion had begun to visit Pin that it would be disagreeably reckless, before such a commitment, not to see some life - to see what lay on the other side of it. 
<br>
&emsp;This conception had impressed her first by its dissimilarity to her other thoughts, and second by what appeared in retrospect to be the suddenness of its arrival. She might say that it had a different texture - a finer or a rougher grain - than her other ideas. 
<br>
&emsp;On numerous occasions, Pin had even remarked to herself that she must have read it in a novel or heard it in a film, though that would have been extremely unlikely, given that she hadn&#39;t read fiction since she was a child - since her parents had, together, taught her to read - and could not for her life pay attention to any sort of movie. 
<br>
&emsp;Guilt was involved because what spirit Pin possessed was implicated in the new notion. To see some life seemed a question of either duty or morality - otherwise a problem of faith. She didn&#39;t have any idea how she would effect it, or of how, realistically, it could look. But then again, as faith, it didn&#39;t truly demand her comprehension. 
<br>
&emsp;Rather than plotting, stewing, or mounting what any observer could have classed as an effort, therefore, Pin lived in her routine exactly as she had always done - awaiting the leapers, whom she knew individually by sight, looking them over, filming them, making surveys of their lairs and updating the record of their breeding patterns accordingly, riding them sometimes in violation of the regulations, and taking care of a few of their multitudinous ailments. 
<br>
&emsp;Meanwhile, she extended what she thought of as her willpower, silently and in private, toward a few objects that had become, for her, the symbols and icons of the Great World. Salem and Century were two of these - Salem perhaps to a greater degree than Century. She felt shy and bashful when he merely crossed her mind; his image glittered there like an opal. She had once seen a large opal set into a platinum ring, and it had looked like a warm, swirling coul&eacute;e of starlight&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;The truth, as she framed it to herself, on those rare occasions when she could bring herself to face the thought of him, was that Salem was both of and from that shining city where people thronged and played with fire planets away: the city of Io. 
<br>
&emsp;She felt she could tell from the way in which he dressed and moved, though she had never visited Io except in her muddled imagination, that he had derived all of his graceful mannerisms from that city. And of the facts that he had been born there and was thus one of the rare natives, she was perfectly convinced, although she had never once asked him directly. 
<br>
&emsp;In all of their sporadic meetings over the course of the last five years, Pin must have asked Salem no more than three or four questions not of an impersonal nature. But she was observant, and she had paid him a very great deal of attention. There were definite strains of irony and languor within his character, and Pin took irony, vaguely, to be a form of decadence endemic to the culture of Io. She couldn&#39;t understand all of his jokes, a fact which supported her in that belief. He often dressed in whites, indigos, and silvers. 
<br>
&emsp;Salem&#39;s arrivals were the greatest disturbances that Pin ever faced, other than the deaths of leapers and his departures. He worked for the government. He caused her amusement, chagrin, and great anxiety. But she liked him, and she adored the way he looked. 
<br>
<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 21px;">2</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>O</b></span>f one-hundred-and-seventy-six Wayfarer&#39;s Runes, Hafiz had as yet collected eighty-three. He had long beaten the game, and the runes were the only remaining side quest. He was attempting to pace himself with them, and so he limited himself to seeking out two per day. 
<br>
&emsp;As rune-gathering often meant a need to earn coins for his passage to other realms by completing simple tasks for villagers or long foot journeys with maneuvers that challenged his understanding of the game&#39;s mechanics, this could occupy him for two or three hours. Therefore, he played at night. After class and after tutoring and the after-school rush at the arcade, in a blue gloom punctuated only by the phantasm of the screen. That way, he saw Dagmara Lothdien&#39;s one-thousand-three-hundred-and-thirteen unique facial expressions with satisfactory clarity. He hated ever to feel that he was missing anything of Princess Lothdien. 
<br>
&emsp;But one had to be extremely circumspect with video games. Hafiz hadn&#39;t been permitted to play them as a child, and so he felt this compunction acutely: video games, viewed in a certain light, sort of were missing out. The kinds of games that attracted him had chiefly to do with the pleasure of the ductility of the avatar - which was identical, he felt, to the pleasure of a psychic forfeiture - what people online called disassociation - a fact which could not be obvious to those who were inattentive to spirit.
<br>
&emsp;A healthy way of mitigating this was by adhering to a routine. For him, that of holding off until the sun had set, and then making sure to feed himself nutritiously at twilight, and then going on a four-kilometer walk at dusk to remind himself why he preferred Otherwise&trade; to things like walking around outside, seemed to do the trick. And all of this preamble also built anticipation. 
<br>
&emsp;Then he returned to his studio apartment, which had just enough space for a sleeping cubby, his desk, and a bathroom that was like a restroom on a train. Apartments on his floor were entirely without kitchens, for many in his city chose to do without them, purchasing all of their meals by subscription to one of a number of feeding services. This was cheaper and a good choice, if you were not very particular about food. 
<br>
&emsp;After his walk, Hafiz usually felt clear and settled - voided of concerns, and therefore ready to inhabit a bright fiction - or rather to be inhabited. The world of Otherwise&trade; was richly appointed. You had to play as Dagmara - well-greaved, orphaned, elven princess on a journey to reclaim her stolen heritage from autocratic, seditious, and physically unlovely goblins, or die with honor in the endeavor. Both her weapons and her armor pulsed with a digital phosphorescence to which Hafiz felt himself to have too easily become accustomed, even to the extent that the dearth of shimmer that characterized real life depressed him when he was not playing the game. This state of affairs he understood to be deleterious. Nevertheless, he had great faith in the routine.
<br>
&emsp;He set up slowly - to hurry would without a doubt ruin things - arranging his desk the way he liked it for OT (this, nonsensically, was the acronym for Otherwise&trade; as described in their logo, rather than the more intuitive and grammatical OW). All of his books were relegated to the floor, as were his notes from class, which he had preferred to handwrite since beginning graduate school. 
<br>
&emsp;Provided it was the dry season, Hafiz always opened the window behind his desk. Gaming felt best  during harmattan, from December to January, when it was cool, breezy, and dry. And then he closed the blinds. He greatly preferred darkness, but there was also something soothing to him in the clatter of the bottom rail on the mullion - from time to time, it rescued him from the rim of a vertiginous torpor that could sometimes envelop him while he played. If he got into that state, then he lost fragments of his memory, he had noticed. 
<br>
&emsp;After closing the blinds, Hafiz would switch keyboards and settle down into his chair - a piece of massive equipment, almost a vehicle, which he had found on the side of the road three or four blocks from where he lived. It had a faulty wheel and was thus apt to rock&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Otherwise&trade; was an experience of presence, even if severely compromised - like everything else. The sword that Dagmara carried was as thin as a needle, and yet it drew absurd, gratuitous amounts of blood. Hafiz appreciated this and other embroidery in the storyworld and didn&#39;t care that it was so exaggerated, for the remainder of his existence, like that of everyone else on his planet, lacked horribly in stimuli.
<br>
<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 21px;">3</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>T</b></span>he higher portions of the escarpment overhung the lower, which had been gnawed by the breakers there for tens of millions of years, like crumbling eaves. Dagmara Lothdien, whose coat, shirt, trousers, gaiters, and undergarments were now drenched, watched the shimmering veil of thin raindrops from the wide maw of a dripping cave in the cliffside. It flickered at regular intervals, like an enchantment. 
<br>
&emsp;It then occurred to her that, on this occasion, she had been very fortunate. The cave that she had burrowed into at the advent of the storm was spacious and generally free of puddles. She could stand in it, if she wanted, to stretch her legs - though she had chosen to remain in a stiff crouch for the time being, facing the entrance. 
<br>
&emsp;The cave&#39;s innards, as far as she could tell, were clogged with a darkness that sometimes appeared to ripple as if it were aqueous, and the sight of that eerie movement congealed her blood. She would not venture there to open caskets of treasure - but she would have to go, she knew, at any moment, to make certain that she was not sharing her shelter with any other being. 
<br>
&emsp;Dagmara steeled herself, despite her trembling. She was aware that she shivered due to exhaustion rather than cold, for they were now several weeks past midwinter, and in the valleys there was no more snow, only weeks of thin rain that created invisible bogs. 
<br>
&emsp;Dagmara lost herself in daydreams for some moments, lured by the moony specters which had been kindled to life by the clatter of the tempest and the bluff, silver light. In her wonderings, she observed that a cold, unfriendly sheen appeared to polish everything beyond her cave, like white enamel. Within a matter of minutes, the world had reverted to a perfect and hostile state - had grown chaotic and pristine and inhumane. Spirits pranced upon the waves. She could just detect their capers above the black and white surf, and the phenomenon gradually filled her with terror&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;And then she remembered where she was and collected herself at once. Standing up with caution, she placed one hand on the slimy stone above her head so that, should it begin suddenly to decline, she would be forewarned. She had no HP left in her for magic, so she would have to do without any light as she entered the guts of the cliffside. 


<br>
<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>

[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 21px;">4</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>A</b></span> group of adolescents turned up in the night, but not the group that Pin had been expecting. She didn&#39;t initially bother to get out of bed; instead, she observed them through the dull footage on her console. Their cautious, svelte figures wavered out as whitish interference from the dim static of the night in infrared. They nosed around her paltry fences, but she observed that they didn&#39;t seem particularly hungry. Just curious. 
<br>
&emsp;If they were the brood of the previous March, as she suspected they were - newly independent - then they appeared to be of a healthyish size for their age. Most of them had the standard merle coats, but the lankiest was buff and also straight-haired. Pin touched her finger to its trunk on the tiny screen. That sweet, buff coloring was exceedingly rare. No leaper that she had ever seen had it all over, and those that had it at all in this region were either brindled - like this one - with bluish black, or brilliantly harlequined with that and a bluish white. This particular creature, which she had called Bridey when it was born, happened also to have a pretty, blackened snout - from its mother.
<br>
&emsp;Bridey - tall, haughty, and hesitant - reminded her of another leaper that she had known some years ago. Seven years, in fact - at the very beginning of her career&#8230;one who had loved her and whom she had called Marchie. It occurred to Pin that she was probably not going to be able to fall back asleep. 
<br>
&emsp;The arrival of the leapers was what had woken her up from a slumber that was doubtful in the first place, for she had long ago set an alarm up to sound on the console whenever the outdoor cameras were triggered into recording by their motion sensors. But sleep, at the very best of times, eluded Pin, and she thought that recently matters had been getting somewhat worse. These days, the effort to fall asleep presented almost as many difficulties as the effort of staying there.
<br>
&emsp;As Pin lamented this, the console began to vibrate violently. She started. It was making a noise that she had never before heard. She sat up at once, almost allowing it to fall from her hands. It had become clear to her that she was receiving some sort of call - but the call came from either an unknown or a concealed badge. Pin felt that she hesitated, but, receiving no explicit direction to halt, her thumb nevertheless accepted the call. 
<br>
&emsp;There was initially a horrible racket. Pin cringed away from it barbarically, and then she held down the volume control until it abated. She could see nothing that was identifiable to her on the screen. The image contorted rapidly, freezing at intervals. She gaped at what appeared to be lattices of blue, black, and gray. In one corner, at one moment, she thought that she, bizarrely, detected clouds.
<br>
&emsp;As she squinted, drawing closer to the image, the clatter was entirely extinguished. She blinked in surprise.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Hello? Is that Pin? &#8230;Why can&#39;t I see you?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;<I>Because it’s dark</I>, Pin thought, but she couldn’t speak, for she had recognized the voice…
<br>
&emsp;&#34;God, how do I&#8230; Hello?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;It was Salem. The image changed, or rather the point of view, and then they were face-to-face. He was outside; she had been right about the clouds, and, now, even more of the sky was visible. It seemed to cloak him - an Earthlike blue. Earthlike in tone, but crystalline. In fact, the very same intemperate sheen that was on the sky was plastered over Salem&#39;s skin. He looked nothing like himself. It was as though she were watching him on television. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I can&#39;t see your face,&#34; He said.
<br>
&emsp;His brow was furrowed in a frown that Pin found winsome and familiar. His head was bowed extremely close to the screen. She thought she could tell that he was fiddling with whatever device he had used to make the call. Her stomach churning, Pin pawed at the darkness with one hand until she had found the pull cord for the bulb that hung at one end of her bed, which was within a narrow, wooden enclosure, rather like a berth. A light came on. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Oh. There you are.&#34; Salem smiled.
<br>
&emsp;Pin wondered what was going on. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I got your badge from Century&#8230; I didn&#39;t even think that you had your own console, Pin.&#34;
Pin was focusing on the tiny square of footage of herself in the bottom right corner. That would be what Salem was seeing. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You haven&#39;t said anything.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem&#39;s voice had softened. As he delivered that complaint, he was jostled, and she heard him curse. He must be on the street. No wonder there had been so much noise. The streets of Io&#8230; But then why had it faded suddenly? It must be because of the two silver globes inside his ears.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Pin&#8230; I&#39;m sorry.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Sorry for what?&#34; She asked in alarm.
<br>
&emsp;He laughed drily. It occurred to her that he, too, was ill at ease.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ve just realized that it&#39;s the middle of the night where you are! No wonder you looked so shocked.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;His contrition was genuine, and Pin hated it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What made you call?&#34; She asked, to divert him.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I wanted to talk to you. I--&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Then he froze again, and Pin&#39;s heart contracted unpleasantly. For the second time, she gazed at shards of blue, warm black, and gray. The next words that she heard were, &#34;&#8230;to come here&#8230;Century says&#8230;agree that&#8230;city is always a good idea&#8230;!&#34; at which point the connection failed, and he vanished entirely. 
<br>
&emsp;Pin stared at the screen in total bewilderment. Nothing of the kind had ever happened in the past. Salem had never tried to call her. As a matter of fact, in all the years that she had owned a console, nobody had. 
<br>
&emsp;As Pin attempted to face her confusion, a terrific clamor began somewhere just outdoors. Like an explosion, it shook the windows. Abandoning the console, she struggled out of bed and to the door, where she drew on her gaitered boots. The noise was so horribly piercing that it seemed to come from within her own head. And she perceived music in it&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;She ran outdoors. A lurid, green flash collided with her on the threshold and did her out of her eyesight, but her legs continued to move, bearing her forward, for she had thought of the four leapers and their terror. What she found when her vision returned in smears, at the eastern border of her little camp, where the adolescent creatures had stood, was black, scorched earth. Or so it seemed, until she realized that it wasn&#39;t hot, though it had appeared to be torrefied - but icy.


<br>
<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>

[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 21px;">5</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>I</b></span>&#39;m telling you, I think it&#39;s the only way to have any sort of life nowadays,&#34; said Nosiru earnestly. 
<br>
&emsp;Hafiz, facing him, barely took in the substance of this statement. He was, as usual, out of his depth in their apartment and treading his own sense of wellbeing.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I think that it&#39;s the only way to have any sort of perspective,&#34; Seun added.
<br>
&emsp;Hafiz said, &#34;But it could be life-threatening.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;The lovers, who sat on threadbare armchairs opposite him in their small and extremely old-fashioned living room, glanced at one another and then laughed. And, in spite of himself, Hafiz grinned along. He was aware of being the butt of the joke, but he couldn&#39;t help it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well - that&#39;s the point.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No, don&#39;t say that, Nosiru. That obviously isn&#39;t the point. We intend to survive the journey and make ourselves useful to the astronauts when we arrive. But then&#8230;&#34; Seun appeared to hesitate. &#34;Well, it&#39;s not clear to me that something like this would be worthwhile for people like us without that risk. That&#39;s where the perspective would come in. Or what do you think, Nosiru?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I'm in complete agreement&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Hafiz fidgeted. He&#39;d begun to suspect that they were serious. <I>But where does that leave me</I>, he wondered.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What will you do,&#34; he asked them. &#34;After you arrive?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well, we&#39;ll have to undergo some training. And that could take up to two years. Neither of us has ever really worked with animals - much less alien ones.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Hafiz cast his mind back to their first meeting, which occurred shortly after he turned twenty-one. Though his memory of all those years had been muddied by his addiction, he could see them very clearly.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Have you always wanted this?&#34; He asked.
<br>
&emsp;They exchanged another glance.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes. Seun has.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Don&#39;t look so heartbroken, Hafiz. We&#39;d be over the moon if you came. You could even have lived here, if you&#39;d wanted. Didn&#39;t we say so?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Hafiz also thought they knew that he wouldn&#39;t want to leave this planet. His neck and shoulders throbbed with tension, and doubt sprouted in him as to whether in this moment his friends were being wholly sincere. They had found one another when he was still an undergraduate - or, rather, they had found him. He hadn&#39;t lifted a finger to be understood. In retrospect, it seemed to have been his parents&#39; final - perhaps their only - effort with him,  to persuade him to move to Colinas and attend his classes in person.
<br>
&emsp;Yet, for the past couple of years, it truly hadn&#39;t signified. In those days, Hafiz hadn&#39;t considered himself to be present there inasmuch as he was incapable of conceiving of himself as an integrated being. Rather, he had been shaped into a sort of antenna for his interests as well as inexorable collateral seas of information, which mainly constituted advertising&#8230; More information, truthfully, than he or anyone could physically stand, and that was why the contours of his being had felt so flimsy and so dubious. 
<br>
&emsp;He had lived, from his earliest childhood, with a sense of being personally compromised - <I>invaded</I> - and he had experienced that as a conviction, no, a certitude of futility. By the time that Hafiz came of age, there was nothing in the world that appeared to him convincingly to want to be unified, integrated, sound, true, or entire. There was in other words no container anywhere for the loose fluid of his consciousness&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;At the time of meeting Seun and Nosiru, he had been playing a lot of video games. With the acuity of hindsight, he perceived that what had manifested itself within him as a vast and repressive individuality - a truly impossible burden - can only have appeared to onlookers to be an almost ghastly expression of compliance, complacency, and convention&#8230; Being unwell - being, in actual fact, nonexistent, except insofar as he could receive mucilaginous streams of data from the infobahn, Hafiz had fashioned himself unwittingly into a copy - a perfect sample of his set - an integer. That was the queer order, the iterative trend that governed lunacy&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;And so it impressed him as a miracle that Nosiru and Seun had been able to see and hear him. To him, it had frankly meant a life. It had meant rescue. And now they claimed to be preparing to fire themselves off into space.
<br>
&emsp;<I>Don&#39;t leave me</I> - the words were there on the tip of his tongue, but he didn&#39;t say them. Hafiz had never uttered such a sentence in his life, and to improvise still unnerved him.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;If you&#39;re happy, then I&#39;m happy,&#34; was what he said instead.
<br> 
&emsp;He had heard this platitude delivered with irony during a falsely pathetic moment in a sit-com some years before.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Don&#39;t forget me!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He watched them slouch suddenly with relief. 
<br>
&emsp;Seun said, &#34;How could we ever, ever, ever forget you?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She came forward to embrace him with force and warmth. When they had first met, Hafiz, whose social and emotional literacy had long degraded to the level of rot, certainly couldn&#39;t have said, even to himself, what it was that he was feeling. He recollected that they had seemed healthy and very beautiful and that those qualities in combination had made them appear otherworldly.
