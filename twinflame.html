<span style = "text-align: center; font-family: 'Nanum Myeongjo'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>~TWIN FLAME 6 TAILS~</b></span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>T</b></span>hey wouldn&#39;t come to earth that was not very well-turned and warm. Pin stalked the perimeter of her camp gradually and made sure that the soil there all appeared a darkish blue. She had her scuffle hoe with her, and she had put on her hat, though there was no need today - simply because seven months ago Salem had asked her to indirectly. 
<br>
&emsp;If memory served, what he had said then was that weather could come on all of a sudden and that it was no good to stand under two suns all morning and afternoon. How Salem knew that, Pin couldn&#39;t tell, for there was said to be no weather, where he was from. And, what was more, standing under two suns all day was what she had been doing without remarking it ever since she was a child. 
<br>
&emsp;Salem had given her this advice in the presence of Century, on the final day of their last Concord Visit, and, in the seven months since that time, Pin had neither seen nor spoken to another of her kind. She was beginning to think that that was what was meant by concord. Her solitude, that is. 
<br>
&emsp;She wasn't in exile, for she had not committed any crime. She wasn't technically companionless, and so her isolation was not cruel. It couldn&#39;t be conceived as any kind of punishment, in short. But she did have a sense almost of guilt - or something like it very foreign that had settled in her chest and spoke into her in clear, true tones. 
<br>
&emsp;Pin was sound; she liked herself and knew what she was good for, which was stewarding the few leapers that remained in this region. And, though she could not consider herself to be spiritual to any degree, she had long decided to make an offering of her capabilities to the land - or to the world. However, in recent months, the new notion had visited her that it would be reckless not, before such a commitment, to see some life - to see what lay on the other side of it. 
<br>
&emsp;This idea had impressed her first by its difference from her other thoughts, and second by what appeared in retrospect to be the suddenness of its conception. She might say it had a different texture - a finer or a rougher grain - than her other ideas. On numerous occasions, she had even remarked to herself that she must have read it in a novel, though that would have been extremely unlikely, given that she hadn&#39;t read fiction since she was a child - since her parents had taught her.
<br>
&emsp;Guilt was involved because what spirit Pin possessed was implicated in the new notion. It seemed a moral obligation, to see some life - or an article of faith. She didn&#39;t have any idea how she would effect it, or of what, realistically, it could look like. But then again, as faith, it didn&#39;t truly demand such knowledge. Rather than plotting, stewing, or mounting what anyone could have viewed as an effort, therefore, Pin lived in her routine exactly as she had always done - waiting for the leapers, whom she knew individually by sight, looking them over, riding them sometimes illegally, updating the record of their breeding patterns, and taking care of their various illnesses and ailments. 
<br>
&emsp;Meanwhile, she extended what she thought of as her willpower, silently and in private, toward a few objects that had become, for her, the symbols and icons of the Great World. Salem and Century were two of these - Salem perhaps more so. She was shy when he crossed her mind; he glittered there like an opal. She had once seen an opal in a ring&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;The truth, as she framed it to herself, on those rare occasions when she could bring herself to face the thought of him, was that Salem was both from and of that shining city where people thronged and played with fire - planets away. The city of Io. 
<br>
&emsp;She felt she could tell from the way in which he dressed and moved, though she had never been to Io except in her clouded imagination, that he had derived all of his mannerisms from that place. He had been born there, she was sure, though she had never asked. In all of their sporadic meetings over the course of the last five years, she must have asked him no more than three or four questions that were not of an impersonal nature. 
<br>
&emsp;But she was observant, and she&#39;d paid him a great deal of attention. He had strains of irony and languor in his character. Pin took irony, vaguely, to be a form of decadence and a part of Io culture. She couldn&#39;t understand all of his jokes. He often dressed in white and silver. 
<br>
&emsp;His arrivals were the greatest disturbances that she ever faced, other than the deaths of leapers and his departures. He caused her amusement, chagrin, and great anxiety. But she liked him, and she liked the way he dressed. 
<br>
<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">2</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>O</b></span>f the one-hundred-and-seventy-six Hermit&#39;s Runes, Hafiz had as yet collected eighty-three. He had long beaten the game, and the runes were the only remaining side quest. He was attempting to pace himself with them, and so he limited himself to seeking out only two per day. As gathering them often meant either earning coins for his passage to other realms by completing simple tasks for villagers, or long foot journeys with maneuvers that challenged his understanding of the game&#39;s mechanics, this could occupy him for up to three or four hours. 
<br>
&emsp;Therefore, he played at night. After class and after the after-school shift at the arcade, in a deep and almost total darkness, interrupted only by the phantasm of the screen. That way, he saw Dagmara Lothdien&#39;s one-thousand-three-hundred-and-thirteen unique facial expressions with satisfactory clarity. He hated ever to feel that he was missing anything of his avatar. 
<br>
&emsp;One had to be circumspect with video games. Hafiz hadn&#39;t been permitted to play them as a child, and so he felt this acutely - video games, viewed in a certain light, were missing out. The kinds that he played had chiefly to do with the pleasure of the ductility of the avatar - which was identical, he felt, to the pleasure of existential forfeiture, a fact which could not be obvious to those who were inattentive to spirit.
<br>
&emsp;A healthy way of mitigating this was by adhering to a routine. For him, that of holding off until the sun had set, making sure to feed himself nutritiously at twilight, and going on a long walk at dusk to remind himself why he preferred <I>Otherwise</I> to things like walking around outside, seemed to help. All of this preamble also built anticipation. 
<br>
&emsp;Then he returned to his cache-studio, which had just enough space for a sleeping cubby, his desk, and a bathroom that was like a restroom on a train. Rooms on his floor were entirely without kitchens, for many in this city chose to do without them and purchase all of their meals. This was cheaper and a good choice, if you were not particular about food. 
<br>
&emsp;After his walk, Hafiz usually felt clear and settled - voided of concerns, and therefore ready to inhabit a bright fiction. Or rather to be inhabited. The world of <I>Otherwise</I> was richly appointed. You played as Dagmara - well-greaved, orphaned, elven princess on a journey to reclaim her stolen heritage from autocratic, seditious, and physically unlovely goblins, or die with honor in the endeavor. Both her weapons and her armor pulsed with a digital phosphorescence to which Hafiz felt himself to have too easily become accustomed, to the extent that the dearth of shimmer that characterized reality depressed him when he was not playing the game. This state of affairs he understood to be exceedingly deleterious. Nevertheless, he had faith in the routine.
<br>
&emsp;He set up slowly - to hurry would without a doubt ruin things - arranging his desk the way he liked it for OT (this, nonsensically, was the acronym for Otherwise as described in their logo, and not the more grammatical OW). All of his books were moved to the floor, as were his notes from class, which he had preferred to handwrite, since beginning graduate school. 
<br>
&emsp;He, provided it was the dry season, always opened the window behind his desk. Gaming felt best in December and January, during harmattan, when it was cool, dry, and breezy. And then he closed the blinds. He greatly preferred darkness, but there was also something soothing to him in the clatter of the bottom rail on the mullion - from time to time, it rescued him from the rim of a vertiginous torpor that could sometimes envelop him while he played games. If he got into that state, then he lost fragments of his memory, he had noticed. 
<br>
&emsp;Then he switched keyboards and settled down into his chair - a piece of massive equipment, almost a vehicle, which he had found on the side of the road three or four blocks from where he lived. It had a faulty wheel and was thus apt to rock&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;<I>Otherwise</I> was an experience of presence, even if severely compromised. The sword that Dagmara carried was as thin as a needle, and yet it drew absurd, gratuitous amounts of blood. Hafiz appreciated this and other embroidery in the game and didn&#39;t care that it was exaggerated, for the remainder of his existence, like that of everyone else on his planet, lacked horribly in stimuli.
<br>
<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">3</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>A</b></span> group of adolescents turned up in the night. Not the group that she had been expecting. Pin didn&#39;t initially bother to get out of bed. Instead, she observed them on her console: their cautious, svelte figures standing out as whitish interference from the black static of the night on infrared footage. They nosed around her possessions, but she observed that they didn&#39;t seem particularly hungry. Just curious. 
<br>
&emsp;If they were the brood of the previous March, as she suspected they were - newly independent - then they appeared to be a fairly healthy size for their age. Most of them had the standard merle coats, but the lankiest was buff and brindled. Pin touched her finger to its trunk on the screen. That sweet, buff coloring was exceedingly rare. No leaper that she had ever seen had it all over, and those that had it at all in this region were either brindled - like this one - with bluish black, or brilliantly harlequined with that and white. This creature, which she had called Bridey when it was born, happened also to have a pretty, black snout - from its mother.
<br>
&emsp;Bridey - tall, haughty, and hesitant - reminded her of another leaper that she had known some years ago. Many years, in fact - at the beginning of her career. One that had loved her, and she had named him Marchie&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;It occurred to Pin that she was probably not going to be able to fall back asleep. The arrival of the leapers was what had woken her from her doubtful slumber, for she had set an alarm up to sound on the console whenever the cameras outside were triggered into recording by their motion sensors. Sleep, at the best of times, eluded her, and she thought that recently things had been getting somewhat worse. Nowadays, the effort to fall asleep presented almost as many difficulties as the effort to stay there.
<br>
&emsp;As Pin contemplated this, the console began to vibrate violently. She started. It was making a noise that she had never before heard. She sat up at once, almost letting it fall from her hands. It had grown clear to her that she was receiving some sort of call - but it was from an unknown or concealed badge. Pin felt that she hesitated, but, receiving no impulse to halt, her thumb accepted the call. 
&emsp;There was initially a horrible racket. Pin cringed away from it barbarically, and then she held down the volume control until it abated. She could see nothing that was identifiable to her on the screen. The image contorted rapidly, freezing at intervals. She gaped at what appeared to be lattices of blue, black, and gray. In one corner, at one moment, she thought she detected, bizarrely, clouds.
As she squinted, drawing closer to the image, the clatter was entirely extinguished. She blinked in surprise.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Hello? Is that Pin? &#8230;Why can&#39;t I see you?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Because it&#39;s dark, Pin thought, but she couldn&#39;t talk. She had recognized the voice. It was Salem. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;God, how do I&#8230; <I>Hello</I>?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;The image changed, or rather the point of view - and they were face-to-face. He was outside. She had been right about the clouds. Now more of the sky was visible. It seemed to cloak him - an Earthlike blue. Earthlike in tone, but crystalline. In fact, the same intemperate sheen that was on the sky was on Salem. He didn&#39;t look like himself. It was as though she were watching him on television. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I can&#39;t see your face,&#34; He said.
<br>
&emsp;His brow was furrowed in a winsome frown. His head was bowed close to the screen. Pin could tell that he was fiddling with whatever device he had used to make the call. Stomach churning, she pawed with one hand at the dark until she had found the pull cord for the bulb that hung at one end of her bed - which was within a narrow, wooden enclosure - like a berth. A light came on. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Oh. There you are.&#34; He smiled.
<br>
&emsp;Pin wondered what was going on. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I got your badge from Century&#8230; I didn&#39;t even think you had your own console!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Pin was focusing on the tiny square of footage of herself in the bottom right corner. That would be what Salem was seeing. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You haven&#39;t said anything.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem&#39;s voice had quietened. As he delivered that complaint, he was jostled. She heard him curse. He must be on the street. No wonder there had been so much noise. The streets of Io. But then why had it faded suddenly? It must be because of the two silver globes inside his ears.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Pin&#8230; I&#39;m sorry.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Sorry for what?&#34; She asked in alarm.
<br>
&emsp;He laughed drily. It occurred to her that he was on edge - like herself.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ve just realized that it&#39;s the middle of the night where you are&#8230; You look so shocked!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;His contrition was genuine; she hated it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What made you call?&#34; She asked, to change the subject. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well, I wanted to talk to you. I--&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Then Salem froze again, and Pin&#39;s heart contracted unpleasantly. Once again, she gazed at shards of blue, black and gray. The next words that she heard were, &#34;&#8230;to come here&#8230;Century thought&#8230;told him. It was a good idea&#8230;&#34; at which point the connection failed, and Salem vanished. 
<br>
&emsp;She stared at the screen in bewilderment. Nothing of the kind had ever happened in the past. Salem had never called her. In fact, no one had. As Pin attempted to confront her confusion, a terrific clamor began somewhere outdoors. Like an explosion, it shook the windows. 
<br>
&emsp;Abandoning the console, Pin clambered out of bed and to the door, drawing on her boots. The noise was so horribly piercing that it seemed to come from within her own head. And she perceived music in it&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Pin ran outdoors. A lurid, green flash met her on the threshold and blinded her, but her legs continued to move, carrying her forward, for she had thought of the leapers and their terror. What she found when her vision returned in smears, at the eastern border of her little camp where the four young creatures had stood, was hot, scorched earth. Or so it appeared, until she realized that it wasn&#39;t hot, though it had looked charred, but ice-cold.
