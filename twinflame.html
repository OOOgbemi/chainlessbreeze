[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 16px;">T</span>he dome winked its tears of fluid light, flashing in stripes upon the lumpy, blue flora. The ground seemed to leap, and Ade startled, before realizing what it was: a phantasm. Balancing on the threshold, he squinted up and saw the wispy, gleaming trails run to the rim, like reins cut from a chariot. Dotun and Hiro were still fast asleep indoors.  
<br>
&emsp;The water stood inside the painted hydria on the deck. Because he had been ill in the past month, their neighbor Avi had been the one to fetch it for them from the desalination plant. But Mide wanted the chore back. He was deeply fond of the desalination plant, whose winding chambers had always looked to him like the hollow carcass of a mighty, paleocene snake. He used to cycle there in the electric blue evenings, alone and light of heart. 
<br>
&emsp;Drinking in the sweet-tasting mists of morning that glissaded in gray across the black-and-white speckled soil, he recollected, smilingly, the earnestness with which Hiro and his sister had opposed him on the issue of that particular errand. The principal point of contention had been his desire to go on his own. They still believed the stories about interlopers, which were true, but not in the ways that they imagined. 
<br>
&emsp;He lifted the hydria to carry it indoors, wincing at the weight. His bones still felt sort of pulpy. It had been years and years since Ade was ill, and so the sensations had come as almost total surprises. Though he was a person who loved surprise, the admixture of true pleasure with the horrid discomforts of his malady had seriously unnerved him. More and more often, he found that his emotional states were dialectics.
<br>
&emsp;Ade set the hydria down next to the stove. He would have to go over to Avi&#39;s house, once he had dressed, and let him know that there was no longer any need for help with this.
