<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>T</b></span>he dome winked its tears of fluid light, flashing in stripes upon the lumpy, blue flora. The ground seemed to leap, and Ade startled, before realizing what it was: a phantasm. Balancing on the threshold, he squinted up and saw the wispy, gleaming trails run to the rim, like reins cut from a chariot. Dotun and Hiro were both still fast asleep indoors.  
<br>
&emsp;The water stood inside the painted hydria on the deck. Because he had been ill in the past month, their neighbor Avi had been the one to fetch it for them from the desalination plant. But Mide wanted the chore back. He was deeply fond of the desalination plant, whose winding chambers had always looked to him like the hollow carcass of a mighty, paleocene snake. He used to cycle there in the electric blue evenings&#8230;alone and light of heart. 
<br>
&emsp;Drinking in the sweet-tasting mists of morning that glissaded in gray across the speckled soil, Ade recollected smilingly the earnestness with which Hiro and his sister had opposed him on the question of that particular errand. The chief point of contention had been his desire to go on his own. They still believed the stories about interlopers, which were true, but not in the ways that they imagined. 
<br>
&emsp;Ade lifted the hydria to carry it indoors, wincing at the weight. He took note of the fact that his bones still felt relatively pulpy. It had been years and years and years since he was ill, and so each of the sensations had come as almost total surprises. 
<br>
&emsp;Though he was a person who loved surprise, the admixture of true pleasure with the horrid discomforts of his malady had seriously unsettled him. More and more often, he found that his emotional states were dialectical.
<br>
&emsp;Ade set the hydria down next to the stove. He would have to go over to Avi&#39;s house, once he had dressed, and let him know that there was no longer any real need for help with this. 
<br>
<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">2</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>H</b></span>iro returned with their breakfast when it was almost midday. Ade hadn&#39;t yet tried to make it to Avi's because the atmosphere had been so lovely and peaceful in their living room, where the milky light of late morning seeped through the thinly papered windows. He lay prone on the rug that he had woven himself from layers of dried brush and synthetic yarn, reading a novel that Dotun had salvaged him from the last craft. 
<br>
&emsp;He could hear her singing something through the walls adjoining her bedroom, but there was a narrow quality to her voice due to their thickness. As he read and listened, Ade took careful stock of the sensations in his body in an unrushed manner. He wanted to know what was the same, since he had been ill, and what was different. 
<br>
&emsp;He re-observed a particular woolliness, which meant that he couldn&#39;t stick with trains of thought for very long, though he could read and handle other tasks with good focus. It was a little like how he felt when walking on slippery ground. An activity was like a cane, but he felt uneasy when he freewheeled. 
<br>
&emsp;His joints hurt him a little, including those in his neck and jaw. But those were not entirely unpleasant sensations. Taken together, they felt similar to the stiffness that gives one the desire to stretch. He had just begun to stretch when Hiro reentered the house. She had wrapped her bounty in a green cloth, and she smiled as she knelt down in front of him to spread it out.
<br>
&emsp;Ade stretched and watched her as she took the first bite of a turnberry and then peeled open a filmfruit. The turnberry looked like a combination of various drupelets from the old world that they had never tasted. The juice was transparent, and it pooled at the corners of her mouth before she licked it off. The filmfruit was full of iridescent, sour fibers.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Have some!&#34; She said.
<br>
&emsp;He took the filmfruit slice that she offered. It was tart almost to the point of bitterness. Here, it grew in and around streamlets.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;How do you feel?&#34; She asked.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Fit,&#34; he said.
<br>
&emsp;They sat cross-legged on the rug, facing each other. She rubbed her ankle. He saw that she had many welts. There were stinging plants outside the dome, where she would have gone to get their food. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Is that true?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes, it&#39;s true.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Where&#39;s your sister?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He pointed to Dotun&#39;s bedroom door, which was tucked into an archway left of the main room, if you were facing the windows.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ve never lied to you.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No&#8230;but you&#39;re not very careful.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He didn&#39;t respond to that because he felt sure that she didn&#39;t mean anything by it. She knew that it wasn&#39;t his fault that he had gotten sick. Only, they were not finished - not nearly finished - learning about what could happen to people on Tau, and, thanks to him, she had a renewed sense of things&#39; precarity.
<br>
&emsp;He didn&#39;t feel at all bad about it, however. Finding all of that out was ostensibly what they were all doing on this planet. In the case of their household, and also that of Avi&#39;s, if it came to that, it was, in a sense, what they were destined for. 
<br>
&emsp;He just got a little green around the gills - and he had found it better to acknowledge this - when he began to think of either his sister or Hiro feeling more anxious more regularly. He didn&#39;t struggle with that at all. He hadn&#39;t even struggled on the ship. He loved Cailly Tau. He was happy and felt resilient. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;The thing is,&#34; He said, picking the fuzzy leaves from a bursting turnberry. &#34;I actually have a prodigious resistance to alien antibodies. That disease would have killed almost anybody else.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Really,&#34; She smiled.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes. It&#39;s because I&#39;m a natural traveler - traveling between worlds. In spirit, I mean. There are fewer barriers for someone like that&#8230;and none between, say, life and death.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He&#39;d told the truth - a version of it - but she didn&#39;t know. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Except for this.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She pinched his arm.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;<I>Ow</I>!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What are you two doing?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Dotun stood in the archway, yawning and rubbing at her eyes.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Ade&#39;s trying to convince me that he&#39;s immortal.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;That&#39;s <I>not</I> what I said.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He put an entire turnberry in his mouth. She watched him chew, and he watched her watch. It was difficult to know, in such a small community, but he thought that he loved Hiro. He really didn&#39;t want her to be frightened.
<br>
<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">3</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;">A</span>de stood at the mouth of the passage, leaning against the wall, watching Avi. Avi was on a stool in front of his hearth, gouging rubber for the newest stamps. He was making them for his son and daughter, who each had a collection.
<br>
&emsp;Avi&#39;s house was gloomier and cozier than theirs. Like a rabbit&#39;s warren, Ade had often thought. The windows were very high up in the wall and wider than they were long. He didn&#39;t cover them up with paper, nor had he bothered with the floor. It felt like being outside, but it was a little bit cooler. He and his children spent hardly any of their time in there. 
<br>
&emsp;The little ones came indoors only when their horseplay had exhausted them, Ade knew, to take naps. But he had seen Ruth, the younger one, sleeping out of doors on a couple of occasions recently. It was a perfectly suitable climate for that, but if his sister and Ai knew, they&#39;d be appalled because they mistrusted the landscape. 
<br>
&emsp;Ade found that very interesting. He was interested in all the different webs of adaptation, so to speak, that the people in his community were spinning. Avi, to his mind, seemed to be skewing toward something haphazardly primal, or toward a vision of fantastic <I>prehistory</I> that had been nourished by the content with which they&#39;d been supplied on the voyage. His two children had been born in this paradise and didn&#39;t know any different.
<br>
&emsp;By contrast, he, Dotun, and Hiro had all been born on the spaceship, and as a result they shared a particular tendency that he attributed to beginning life in long transit. In a certain way, they were superstitious. Yet, if they believed in anything specifically mystical, it was earth&#39;s doomsday, the idea that they had all escaped.
<br>
&emsp;But Ade was beginning to want to eschew that notion. Something in him resisted its vertiginous appeal these days. The fact was that he felt uneasy about the prospect of accepting the sense of <I>mission</I>, of duty, that it would naturally place on their shoulders. To him, that degree of responsibility was ill-omened, especially in such a rich and balanced land. Humans had buckled under false duties before.
<br>
&emsp;What he relied on now, instead, was his sense that the planet would, in every moment, tell them exactly what to do. He had operated under this assumption for almost a year unconsciously and then later stumbled across his own ideas scribbled in a journal belonging to a member of the second wave, who, after half a century on Cailly Tau, had deserted the dome to perish in the wilderness. 
<br>
&emsp;The theory then consolidated itself in his conscious mind: rather than taming their environment, they could simply ask it to refashion them as other people. Hiro and Dotun, to whom he had lent the journal (which he had borrowed from the base library) liked it as well. He&#39;d wanted them to like it because he felt that it was all already happening. 
<br>
&emsp;That was why it had pleased him so to see little Ruth asleep outdoors. Ade felt that, as a community, they were growing more human and less human and growing up. 
<br>
<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">4</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>D</b></span>uring his illness, Ade could not bear to be anywhere but on the floor of their front room. But the touch of the straw with which the ground was covered - his rug - had made him shiver, so they had lain blankets over it. He was delirious for seven days. He recollected luminous shapes on the walls at night when his sister and Hiro had surrounded him with lanterns and watched with him. He had the impression of having dreamt continuously for a week.
<br>
&emsp;He knew, because he remembered vividly their hushed, sober voices, that they had spoken to him a great deal, but he couldn&#39;t recollect a word of what they had said. That is, not consciously. He believed that he did remember in <I>some</I> way because, when he was well again, he saw them both very differently. But his actual dreams were harrowing, disfigured as they had been by undesirable and unnerving physical sensations, such that he had borne the burden of an infested mind as well as that of a body at variance with itself. The advantage of having Dotun and Hiro around him was therefore mainly that of anchors to self-recognition. 
<br>
&emsp;Of course, they were family, and Dotun was related to him by blood, though their mission and the seclusion of their upbringing had diluted the significance of that fact somewhat, or considerably. But now, that is since becoming well again, he found himself prioritizing, psychically, their shared and incidental role as the nexus of his survival. He adored this sense of interdependence&#59; it gave him the most profound pleasure. 
<br>
&emsp;Therefore, when he reflected on that time - the lambent room, the combined heavy sweetness and herbal sharpness of the dried fronds that constituted their flooring, which ascended even through the close fibers of the blankets, whose dark red and blue were a rich comfort to the eye, and the deep, clean fragrance of the soil beneath them all, the moving shadows which spoke to him, their baseless language, the cautious touches that he felt even through sleep, their tender speech - it was with a sense of deepest satisfaction and wellbeing. 
<br>
<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">5</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>H</b></span>is sister had told him many things about himself that he found difficult to credit. Ade could concede that her memory of certain periods of his life was likely more reliable than his own, since she was older. But he could not recollect, try as he might, any of the episodes that she accused him of having had while they were still in transit.
<br>
&emsp;And, what was much stranger, she associated these episodes in some way with his recent illness, an ordeal which he couldn&#39;t imagine forgetting. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Do you remember the people who you used to talk to when you were little?&#34; She had asked him once.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes - in the sense that I know that I had many imaginary friends.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;We all did. But you couldn&#39;t be reached when you were in that state.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;When I was little?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes, and then again when you were older. It was&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She hesitated.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;It was what?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I was going to say it was like a kind of delirium.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;These conversations greatly disturbed Ade, who thought of himself as a medium in the sense that he channeled impressions from his environment, which led him to safe and profitable decisions. In other words, only through the external world, that is, the world of Ciely Tau, did he become a thinking being.
<br>
&emsp;His life before the arrival, he considered a gestation. That was the way in which they had been encouraged to think of it on the ship, and that way of thinking suited him perfectly. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You were different - your personality was different. We can&#39;t believe how much you&#39;ve changed.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;She meant herself and Hiro. Ade reflected on this tensely. The fact of the matter was that he hadn&#39;t seen very much of Hiro on the journey. That was the consequence of several new regulations that had followed the Miid-9 attacks, which had taken place when he was only a newborn. 
<br>
&emsp;But there had been such long periods of unconsciousness on the ship in any case, interspersed with weeks of virtual school and cherished communal lessons. When he thought of outer space, therefore, he thought of intense grogginess and little else. But he&#39;d still loved it as he loved life in general - the moments of awakening in particular. They had not come to him as a shock, which was Hiro&#39;s experience. Nor had he felt any pain with them, as had Dotun. 
<br>
&emsp;Instead, it had been a question of recognizing light, faces, and remembering what they were. The bounty of information that was in everything one touched. A rest from dreams that had become vertiginously abstract. 
<br>
&emsp;The sleep itself was said to be salubrious, good for the psyche. He supposed that it would take them many more years to discover whether or not that was actually the case.
<br>
<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">6</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>A</b></span>de considered that he was fairly good at doing tricks with the bike. But he knew that he would soon have to stop (though it thrilled Ruth and Isaac to watch him) because it wasn&#39;t built for that, and there was a very small likelihood of replacing it or any of its parts should something happen to it. He rode it now on a thin plank that was balanced on a number of overturned jerry cans, while the two children marveled and applauded. 
<br>
&emsp;He considered hopping the bike off the end of the platform, a feat which he had attempted numerous times in the past, with about a thirty-three percent success rate, but then Ruth&#39;s attention was captured by something that rippled beyond the dome.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I see it! I see it!&#34; She cried, jumping.
<br>
&emsp;Ade toppled, but managed to reach his makeshift off-ramp and safely dismount before he fell. Ruth was sprinting to the nearest plate of hyperglass, and her circumspect brother wavered, gazing after her. It was a Sailor. 
<br>
&emsp;Great, magenta, gel-like creatures, whose bodies were transparent. They had no visible internal organs, though it did seem, under certain kinds of light, that they had a sort of iridescent skin. They were as big as houses, and by all accounts, benign. Their only curious, not to say unsettling behavior, was the trick they had of appearing out of thin air. One never saw a Sailor&#39;s approach or departure. Under observation, they simply surged and oscillated in place. Ade had certainly never seen one traveling.
<br>
&emsp;They had been nicknamed Sailors by the first wavers, but their reason for giving the creature this odd appellation had died with them. Their scientific name was <I>Ennea elegans</I>.
<br>
&emsp;Ruth pressed her nose and hands against the glass, gazing at the solitary billow of a creature who undulated in the filmy light of the two suns, a little less than a quarter of a mile away from the dome. It was unusual to see a Sailor on its own. Ade had observed - and it was written in the incomplete notebooks of the first-wave biologist Valentine Xia - that they most often traveled in trios.
<br>
&emsp;He laid his bike down carefully  on the grass.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Come on,&#34; He said to cautious Isaac.
<br>
&emsp;Isaac took his hand, and they joined Ruth by the hyperglass.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Please, let&#39;s go,&#34; The girl murmured in the most plaintive voice that anyone had ever heard.
<br>
&emsp;It surprised Ade, and he gazed at her.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Go where?&#34; He asked.
<br>
&emsp;She didn&#39;t respond, but pressed her tiny hands to the bluish, striated glass.
<br>
<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">7</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>A</b></span>nd she was desperate to go to it,&#34; Ade explained later on that day to Hiro. 
<br>
&emsp;They were sitting by the hearth, where a fire was lit - to cook with rather than for warmth. Of all the cooking technologies that they had access to, fire was the one that they preferred because it was such a novelty. They had not been permitted to deal with fire on the spaceship.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Desperate?&#34; Hiro murmured, stirring the pot, which contained a salty, blue broth made from the petals of a particular wildflower.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Yes, desperate,&#34; Ade said into the steam.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;&#8230;Well, she&#39;s curious,&#34; Hiro murmured at length, replacing the lid. &#34;She&#39;s a child.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;It&#39;s not the way Isaac behaves.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;But you know how Isaac is.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;Ade frowned. Hiro studied him.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;If you&#39;re worried, then maybe you should talk to her father.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Avi will see it differently. He always prefers for them to do whatever they want.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Well, then I don&#39;t know what&#39;s next.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;He stared at her until she sighed.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s anything to be concerned about. Ruth probably sees it as a big pink toy. She&#39;s seven years old.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;You should have heard her voice.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Everything that children say sounds heartbreaking. It&#39;s the earnestness. You&#39;d be especially vulnerable to it because you&#39;re tenderhearted.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;It was one of many moments with Hiro that made him suspect that she remembered. But she didn&#39;t. She was part of the subgroup that had suffered severe memory loss as a side-effect of the induced sleeps. 
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;It&#39;s not about that,&#34; He argued quietly, and her gaze softened.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Chop up some leeks for me,&#34; She said.
<br> 
&emsp;Leeks were one of the old-world plants that had taken right to Ceily soil. Other alliums also did well there, but not chives. 
<br> 
&emsp;Ade went to what they jokingly referred to as the butler&#39;s pantry, where the leeks and the rest of the recent harvest were stored in baskets. What happened whilst he chopped the leeks was that he immediately cut his hand. He watched himself spilling over the fibrous tops. Green and red. There was so much blood that he couldn&#39;t see the injury.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;Hiro,&#34; He said.
<br> 
&emsp;She turned, and her face set. She stood up and took up a tea-towel and pressed it to his finger, which he could feel was divided somehow between a part that he could sense and a part that he couldn&#39;t. The tea-towel blushed darkly with his blood.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;It doesn&#39;t hurt,&#34; He mumbled, but when she lifted the towel to look, there was a sensation like a seam ripping, and he winced.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ll fetch your sister.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;Of the three of them, Dotun was the best at giving stitches (she had twice given them to herself), but she was just then at Avi&#39;s, where she had been spending more and more of her evenings as of late. Ade sat down on the ground and waited. The fragrance of his blood turned his stomach. He had been thinking about poor Ruth when he cut himself. Children were sensitive to things that adults didn&#39;t know.
