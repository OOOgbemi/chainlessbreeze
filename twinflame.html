<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>L</b></span>eapers would not loiter in soil that was not exceedingly well-turned and warm, and, as such, Pin stalked the entire perimeter of her little encampment, sedately ensuring that every inch of the loam there appeared an inviting grayish-blue. She had a miniature scuffle hoe with her, and she also sported her smart visor, though there was no real need for it, simply because seven months ago Salem had asked her to do so, albeit indirectly. 
<br>
&emsp;If memory served, what he had actually said was that weather could come on quite suddenly and that it was, in his view, <q>no good</q> to stand under two suns throughout the mornings and afternoons, even on cool days. How Salem could be aware of all of that, Pin couldn&#39;t tell, for there was said to be no weather to speak of, where he was from. And - what was more - standing under two suns from morning until night was what she had been doing without fuss or compunction since she was a girl. Both of her parents had worked with leapers as well. There was a sense in which they had also been conservationists.
<br>
&emsp;Salem had given her this superfluous advice in the presence of Century on the final day of their most recent concord visit while beaming sunnily at her, and in the six months since that time, Pin had indeed neither seen nor spoken to another of her species. She had sent emails to Century, but Century didn&#39;t generally respond to her emails; that, as she understood it, was not in his purview. But Pin was beginning to think that this was precisely what was meant by concord. That is, her solitude.
<br> 
&emsp;She was not in exile, for certainly she was not guilty of any crime. Nor was she technically without companions, and so her isolation could not truthfully be characterized as cruel. Moreover, Pin&#39;s heart had chosen this path for her; she had coveted her current position for nearly a decade before assuming it. And yet! &#8230;And yet she did truly have a sense of grievance or of something like it that felt both belittling and foreign. Whatever it was, it had contrived to nestle itself in her rib cage, and, often, from there, it seemed to speak into her core in clear, true tones&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Pin had been advised both by Century and by his predecessor that she was <q>sound,</q> and the truth was that, privately, she believed them. She felt that she knew what exactly it was that she was good for, which was to minister to and to steward the few leapers that survived in this region. And, though she could not consider herself to be in any degree spiritual, she had long decided to make an offering of her capabilities to the land, such as they were - or to the cosmos. And at the same time, in recent months, the new notion had begun to visit Pin that it would be disagreeably reckless, before such a commitment, not to see some life - to see what lay on the other side of it. 
<br>
&emsp;This conception had impressed her first by its dissimilarity to her other thoughts, and second by what appeared in retrospect to be the suddenness of its arrival. She might say that it had a different texture - a finer or a rougher grain - than her other ideas. 
<br>
&emsp;On numerous occasions, Pin had even remarked to herself that she must have read it in a novel or heard it in a film, though that would have been extremely unlikely, given that she hadn&#39;t read fiction since she was a child - since her parents had, together, taught her to read - and could not for the life of her pay attention to any sort of movie. 
<br>
&emsp;Guilt was involved because what spirit Pin possessed was implicated in the new notion. To see some life seemed a question of either duty or morality - otherwise a problem of faith. She didn&#39;t have any idea how she would effect it, or of how, realistically, it could look. But then again, as faith, it didn&#39;t truly demand her comprehension. 
<br>
&emsp;Rather than plotting, stewing, or mounting what any observer could have classed as an effort, therefore, Pin lived in her routine exactly as she had always done - awaiting the leapers, whom she knew individually by sight, looking them over, filming them, making surveys of their lairs and updating the record of their breeding patterns accordingly, riding them sometimes in violation of the regulations, and taking care of a few of their multitudinous ailments. 
<br>
&emsp;Meanwhile, she extended what she thought of as her willpower, silently and in private, toward a few objects that had become, for her, the symbols and icons of the Great World. Salem and Century were two of these - Salem perhaps to a greater degree than Century. She felt shy and bashful when he merely crossed her mind; his image glittered there like an opal. She had once seen a large opal set into a platinum ring, and it had looked like a warm, swirling coul&eacute;e of starlight&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;The truth, as she framed it to herself, on those rare occasions when she could bring herself to face the thought of him, was that Salem was both of and from that shining city where people thronged and played with fire planets away: the city of Io. 
<br>
&emsp;She felt she could tell from the way in which he dressed and moved, though she had never visited Io except in her muddled imagination, that he had derived all of his graceful mannerisms from that city. And of the facts that he had been born there and was thus one of the rare natives, she was perfectly convinced, although she had never once asked him directly. 
<br>
&emsp;In all of their sporadic meetings over the course of the last five years, Pin must have asked Salem no more than three or four questions not of an impersonal nature. But she was observant, and she had paid him a very great deal of attention. There were definite strains of irony and languor within his character, and Pin took irony, vaguely, to be a form of decadence endemic to the culture of Io. She couldn&#39;t understand all of his jokes, a fact which supported her in that belief. He often dressed in whites, indigos, and silvers. 
<br>
&emsp;Salem&#39;s arrivals were the greatest disturbances that Pin ever faced, other than the deaths of leapers and his departures. He worked for the government. He caused her amusement, chagrin, and great anxiety. But she liked him, and she adored the way he looked. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">2</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>O</b></span>f one-hundred-and-seventy-six Wayfarer&#39;s Runes, <a href id = "Chapter2" class = "chapterlinks">Hafiz</a> had as yet collected eighty-three. He'd long beaten the game, and the runes were the only remaining side quest. He was attempting to pace himself with them, and so he limited himself to seeking out two per day. 
<br>
&emsp;As rune-gathering often meant a need to earn coins for his passage to other realms by completing simple tasks for villagers or long foot journeys with maneuvers that challenged his understanding of the game&#39;s mechanics, this could occupy him for two or three hours. Therefore, he played at night. After class and after tutoring and the after-school rush at the arcade, in a blue gloom punctuated only by the phantasm of the screen. That way, he saw Dagmara Lothdien&#39;s one-thousand-three-hundred-and-thirteen unique facial expressions with satisfactory clarity. He hated ever to feel that he was missing anything of Princess Lothdien. 
<br>
&emsp;But one had to be extremely circumspect with video games. Hafiz hadn&#39;t been permitted to play them as a child, and so he felt this compunction acutely: video games, viewed in a certain light, sort of were missing out. The kinds of games that attracted him had chiefly to do with the pleasure of the ductility of the avatar - which was identical, he felt, to the pleasure of a psychic forfeiture - what people online called disassociation - a fact which could not be obvious to those who were inattentive to spirit.
<br>
&emsp;A healthy way of mitigating this was by adhering to a routine. For him, that of holding off until the sun had set, and then making sure to feed himself nutritiously at twilight, and then going on a four-kilometer walk at dusk to remind himself why he preferred Otherwise&trade; to things like walking around outside, seemed to do the trick. And all of this preamble also built anticipation. 
<br>
&emsp;Then he returned to his studio apartment, which had just enough space for a sleeping cubby, his desk, and a bathroom that was like a restroom on a train. Apartments on his floor were entirely without kitchens, for many in his city chose to do without them, purchasing all of their meals by subscription to one of a number of feeding services. This was cheaper and a good choice, if you were not very particular about food. 
<br>
&emsp;After his walk, Hafiz usually felt clear and settled - voided of concerns, and therefore ready to inhabit a bright fiction - or rather to be inhabited. The world of Otherwise&trade; was richly appointed. You had to play as Dagmara - well-greaved, orphaned, elven princess on a journey to reclaim her stolen heritage from autocratic, seditious, and physically unlovely goblins, or die with honor in the endeavor. Both her weapons and her armor pulsed with a digital phosphorescence to which Hafiz felt himself to have too easily become accustomed, even to the extent that the dearth of shimmer that characterized real life depressed him when he was not playing the game. This state of affairs he understood to be deleterious. Nevertheless, he had great faith in the routine.
<br>
&emsp;He set up slowly - to hurry would without a doubt ruin things - arranging his desk the way he liked it for OT (this, nonsensically, was the acronym for Otherwise&trade; as described in their logo, rather than the more intuitive and grammatical OW). All of his books were relegated to the floor, as were his notes from class, which he had preferred to handwrite since beginning graduate school. 
<br>
&emsp;Provided it was the dry season, Hafiz always opened the window behind his desk. Gaming felt best  during harmattan, from December to January, when it was cool, breezy, and dry. And then he closed the blinds. He greatly preferred darkness, but there was also something soothing to him in the clatter of the bottom rail on the mullion - from time to time, it rescued him from the rim of a vertiginous torpor that could sometimes envelop him while he played. If he got into that state, then he lost fragments of his memory, he had noticed. 
<br>
&emsp;After closing the blinds, Hafiz would switch keyboards and settle down into his chair - a piece of massive equipment, almost a vehicle, which he had found on the side of the road three or four blocks from where he lived. It had a faulty wheel and was thus apt to rock&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Otherwise&trade; was an experience of presence, even if severely compromised - like everything else. The sword that Dagmara carried was as thin as a needle, and yet it drew absurd, gratuitous amounts of blood. Hafiz appreciated this and other embroidery in the storyworld and didn&#39;t care that it was so exaggerated, for the remainder of his existence, like that of everyone else on his planet, lacked horribly in stimuli.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>
[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">3</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>T</b></span>he <a href id = "Chapter3" class = "chapterlinks">higher</a> portions of the escarpment overhung the lower, which had been gnawed by the breakers there for tens of millions of years, like crumbling eaves. Dagmara Lothdien, whose coat, shirt, trousers, gaiters, and undergarments were now drenched, watched the shimmering veil of silver raindrops from the wide maw of a dripping cave in the cliffside. It flickered at regular intervals, like an enchantment. 
<br>
&emsp;It then occurred to her that, on this occasion, she had been very fortunate. The cave that she had burrowed into at the advent of the storm was spacious and largely free of puddles. She could stand in it, if she wanted, to stretch her legs - though she had chosen to remain in a stiff crouch for the time being, facing the entrance. 
<br>
&emsp;The cave&#39;s innards, as far as she could tell, were clogged with a darkness that sometimes appeared to ripple as if it were aqueous, and the sight of that eerie movement congealed her blood. She would not venture there to open caskets of treasure - but she would have to go, she knew, at any moment, to make certain that she was not sharing her shelter with any other being. 
<br>
&emsp;Dagmara steeled herself, despite her trembling. She was aware that she shivered due to exhaustion rather than to cold, for they were now a month and a half beyond midwinter, and in the valleys there was no more snow, only weeks and weeks of thin rain that spawned invisible marshes. 
<br>
&emsp;Dagmara lost herself in daydreams for some moments, lured away from herself by the moony specters which had been kindled to life by the clatter of the tempest and the bluff, silver light. In her wonderings, she observed that a cold, unfriendly sheen appeared to polish everything beyond her cave, like white enamel. Within a matter of minutes, the world had reverted to a perfect and hostile state - had grown chaotic and pristine and inhumane. Spirits pranced upon the waves. She could just detect their capers above the black and white surf, and the phenomenon gradually filled her with terror&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;And then she remembered where she was and collected herself immediately. Standing up with caution, she placed one hand on the slimy stone above her head so that, should it begin suddenly to decline, she would be forewarned. She had no HP left in her for magic, so she would have to do without any light as she entered the guts of the cliffside. 


<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>

[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">4</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>A</b></span> group <a href id = "Chapter4" class = "chapterlinks">of</a> adolescents turned up in the night, but not the group that Pin had been expecting. She didn&#39;t initially bother to get out of bed; instead, she observed them through the dull footage on her console. Their cautious, svelte figures wavered out as whitish interference from the dim static of the night in infrared. They nosed around her paltry fences, but she observed that they didn&#39;t seem particularly hungry. Just curious. 
<br>
&emsp;If they were the brood of the previous March, as she suspected they were - newly independent - then they appeared to be of a healthyish size for their age. Most of them had the standard merle coats, but the lankiest was buff and also straight-haired. Pin touched her finger to its trunk on the tiny screen. That sweet, buff coloring was exceedingly rare. No leaper that she had ever seen had it all over, and those that had it at all in this region were either brindled - like this one - with bluish black, or brilliantly harlequined with that and a bluish white. This particular creature, which she had called Bridey when it was born, happened also to have a pretty, blackened snout - from its mother.
<br>
&emsp;Bridey - tall, haughty, and hesitant - reminded her of another leaper that she had known some years ago. Seven years, in fact - at the very beginning of her career&#8230;one who had loved her and whom she had called Marchie. It occurred to Pin that she was probably not going to be able to fall back asleep. 
<br>
&emsp;The arrival of the leapers was what had woken her up from a slumber that was doubtful in the first place, for she had long ago set an alarm up to sound on the console whenever the outdoor cameras were triggered into recording by their motion sensors. But sleep, at the very best of times, eluded Pin, and she thought that recently matters had been getting somewhat worse. These days, the effort to fall asleep presented almost as many difficulties as the effort of staying there.
<br>
&emsp;As Pin lamented this, the console began to vibrate violently. She started. It was making a noise that she had never before heard. She sat up at once, almost allowing it to fall from her hands. It had become clear to her that she was receiving some sort of call - but the call came from either an unknown or a concealed badge. Pin felt that she hesitated, but, receiving no explicit direction to halt, her thumb nevertheless accepted the call. 
<br>
&emsp;There was initially a horrible racket. Pin cringed away from it barbarically, and then she held down the volume control until it abated. She could see nothing that was identifiable to her on the screen. The image contorted rapidly, freezing at intervals. She gaped at what appeared to be lattices of blue, black, and gray. In one corner, at one moment, she thought that she, bizarrely, detected clouds.
<br>
&emsp;As she squinted, drawing closer to the image, the clatter was entirely extinguished. She blinked in surprise.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Hello? Is that Pin? &#8230;Why can&#39;t I see you?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;<I>Because it&#39;s dark</I>, Pin thought, but she couldn&#39;t speak, for she had recognized the voice&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;God, how do I&#8230; Hello?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;It was Salem. The image changed, or rather the point of view, and then they were face-to-face. He was outside; she had been right about the clouds, and, now, even more of the sky was visible. It seemed to cloak him - an Earthlike blue. Earthlike in tone, but crystalline. In fact, the very same intemperate sheen that was on the sky was plastered over Salem&#39;s skin. He looked nothing like himself. It was as though she were watching him on television. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I can&#39;t see your face,&#34; He said.
<br>
&emsp;His brow was furrowed in a frown that Pin found winsome and familiar. His head was bowed extremely close to the screen. She thought she could tell that he was fiddling with whatever device he had used to make the call. Her stomach churning, Pin pawed at the darkness with one hand until she had found the pull cord for the bulb that hung at one end of her bed, which was within a narrow, wooden enclosure, rather like a berth. A light came on. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Oh. There you are.&#34; Salem smiled.
<br>
&emsp;Pin wondered what was going on. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I got your badge from Century&#8230; I didn&#39;t even think that you had your own console, Pin.&#34;
Pin was focusing on the tiny square of footage of herself in the bottom right corner. That would be what Salem was seeing. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You haven&#39;t said anything.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem&#39;s voice had quietened. As he delivered that complaint, he was jostled, and she heard him utter a mild curse. He must be on the street - no wonder there had been so much noise. On the streets of Io… But then why had the ruckus faded so suddenly? It must be because of the two silver globes inside his ears.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Pin&#8230; I&#39;m sorry.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Sorry for what?&#34; She asked in alarm.
<br>
&emsp;He laughed drily. It occurred to her that he, too, was ill at ease.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;ve just realized that it&#39;s the middle of the night where you are! No wonder you looked so shocked.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;His contrition was genuine, and Pin hated it.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What made you call?&#34; She asked, to divert him.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well, I wanted to talk to you! I--&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Then he froze again, and Pin&#39;s heart contracted unpleasantly. For the second time, she gazed at shards of blue, warm black, and gray. The next words that she heard were, &#34;&#8230;to come here…since Century says…I think...always a good thing!Io&#8230;&#34; at which point the connection failed, and he vanished entirely. 
<br>
&emsp;Pin stared at the screen in total bewilderment. Nothing of the kind had ever happened in the past. Salem had never tried to call her. As a matter of fact, in all the years that she had owned a console, nobody had. 
<br>
&emsp;As Pin attempted to face her confusion, a terrific clamor began somewhere just outdoors. Like an explosion, it shook the windows. Abandoning the console, she struggled out of bed and to the door, where she drew on her gaitered boots. The noise was so horribly piercing that it seemed to come from within her own head. And she perceived music in it&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;She ran outdoors. A lurid, green flash collided with her on the threshold and did her out of her eyesight, but her legs continued to move, bearing her forward, for she had thought of the five leapers and their terror. What she found when her vision returned in smears, at the eastern border of her little camp, where the adolescent creatures had stood, was black, scorched earth. Or so it seemed, until she realized that it wasn&#39;t hot, though it had appeared to be torrefied - but icy.


<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>

[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">5</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>I</b></span>&#39;m telling <a href id = "Chapter5" class = "chapterlinks">you</a>, I believe that this is the <I>only</I> kind of life,&#34; said Nosiru earnestly. 
<br>
Hafiz, facing him, barely took in the substance of this statement. He was, as usual, out of his depth in their apartment and treading his own sense of wellbeing.
<br>
&#34;It&#39;s the only way of gaining any sort of perspective,&#34; Seun added.
<br>
Hafiz thought and then said, &#34;But it could be life-threatening.&#34;
<br>
The lovers, who sat on threadbare armchairs opposite him in their small and extremely old-fashioned living room, glanced at one another and then laughed heartily. And, in spite of himself, Hafiz grinned along. He was aware of being the butt of the joke, but he couldn&#39;t help it.
<br>
&#34;Well - that&#39;s the point.&#34;
<br>
&#34;No, don&#39;t say that, Nosiru. That obviously isn&#39;t the point. We intend to survive the journey and make ourselves useful to the astronauts when we arrive. But then&#8230;&#34; Seun appeared to hesitate. &#34;Well, it&#39;s just not clear to me that something like this would be&#8230;<I>worthwhile</I> for people like us without that risk. That&#39;s where the perspective comes in. Or what do you think, Nosiru?&#34;
<br>
&#34;I perfectly agree.&#34;
<br>
Hafiz fidgeted. He had begun to suspect that they were serious. But where does that leave me, he wondered.
<br>
&#34;What will you do,&#34; he asked them. &#34;After you arrive?&#34;
<br>
&#34;Well, we&#39;ll have to undergo training, and that could take up to two years. Neither of us has ever really worked with animals - much less alien ones.&#34;
<br>
&#34;But…&#34;
<br>
Hafiz cast his mind back to their first meeting, which took place shortly after he became twenty-one. Though his memory of all those years had been muddied by his addiction, he could see his joyful recovery clearly.
<br>
&#34;Have you always wanted this?&#34; He asked.
<br>
They exchanged another glance.
<br>
&#34;Yes. Seun has.&#34;
<br>
&#34;Don&#39;t look so heartbroken, Hafiz. We&#39;d be over the moon if you came with us. You could even have lived here, if you&#39;d wanted. Didn&#39;t we say so?&#34;
<br>
Hafiz also thought they knew that he wouldn&#39;t want to leave this planet. His neck and shoulders throbbed with tension, and doubt sprouted in him as to whether in this moment his friends were being totally sincere. They had found one another when he was still an undergraduate - or, rather, they had found him. But the fact was that Hafiz hadn&#39;t lifted a finger to be understood. In retrospect, it seemed to have been his parents&#39; final - perhaps their only - effort with him,  to persuade him to move to Colinas and attend classes in person. Yet, for the past couple of years, it truly hadn&#39;t signified. In those days, Hafiz hadn&#39;t considered himself to be present there inasmuch as he was incapable of considering himself as an integrated and dynamic being. Rather, he had been whittled into an impossibly thin and excruciatingly tender sort of antenna for his interests as well as inevitable and government-sanctioned collateral seas of information, which mainly constituted advertising&#8230; More information, truthfully, than he or anyone could physically stand, and that was why the contours of his being had felt so flimsy - so dubious. 
<br>
He had lived, from his earliest childhood, with a sense of being personally compromised - invaded - and he experienced that as a certitude of futility. By the time that Hafiz came of age, there was nothing in the world that appeared to him convincingly to want to be unified, integrated, sound, true, or entire. There was in other words no solid container anywhere for the loose fluid of his consciousness&#8230;
<br>
At the time of meeting Seun and Nosiru, he had certainly been playing a lot of video games. With the acuity of hindsight, he perceived that what had manifested itself within him as a vast and repressive individuality - a truly impossible burden - can only have appeared to onlookers to be an almost ghastly expression of compliance, complacency, and convention&#8230; Being unwell - being, in actual fact, nonexistent, except insofar as he could receive and register mucilaginous streams of data from the infobahn, Hafiz had fashioned himself unwittingly into a copy - a perfect sample of his set - an integer. That was the queer order, the iterative trend that governed lunacy&#8230;
<br>
And so it impressed him as a miracle that Nosiru and Seun had been able to see and hear him. To him, it had frankly meant a life. It had meant rescue. And now they claimed to be preparing to fling themselves off into outer space.
<br>
<I>Please don&#39;t leave me</I> - the words were there on the tip of his tongue, but he did not dare say them. Hafiz had never before uttered such a sentence, and to improvise still greatly unnerved him. 
<br>
&#34;If you&#39;re happy, then I&#39;m happy,&#34; was what he said instead. He had heard this platitude delivered with irony during a falsely pathetic moment in a sit-com some years before. &#34;But don&#39;t forget me.&#34;
<br>
He watched them slouch suddenly with relief. 
<br>
Seun said, &#34;How could we ever, ever, ever forget <I>you</I>?&#34;
<br>
She came forward to embrace him with her customary warm force. When they had first met, Hafiz, whose social and emotional literacy had long since degraded to the level of rot, certainly couldn&#39;t have said, even to himself, what it was that he was feeling. He recollected that they had seemed healthy and very beautiful and that those qualities in combination had made them appear otherworldly. 
What felt clear to him in this moment was that their attention had, over the course of years, given him first an opaque outline and then carefully shaded him in.

[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">6</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>D</b></span>agmara was <a href id = "Chapter6" class = "chapterlinks">aware</a> of a sinister presence within the cave, yet it was a presence who appeared to speak her language. That is, the language of her ancestral house. Loth was a ceremonial tongue and also a secret one, forbidden to be uttered within the hearing of strangers. It was only ever spoken even by Lothdien elves in ritual as a tribute to the household gods on the occasions of births, deaths, comings-of-age, which were multiple amongst their species, and marriages.
<br>
&emsp;Dagmara had lost her opportunity to learn it, for there was no formal training in Loth until early adolescence. All that was left to her now was the cadence - a tonal memory - and all who had spoken it fluently were buried. And so it diluted her courage to hear those eldritch whispers in this forgotten place. 
<br>
&emsp;A spell, she thought to herself at first, standing still. Her left arm was still raised, so that her fingers brushed the clammy stone. Her other hand fondled the jeweled pommel of her sword unconsciously. It was a gesture that tended to give her great solace&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Not for the first time, the Princess sensed, as she listened to Loth utterances, that the joy of understanding lay just beyond the rim of her perspective - as something under the horizon. It was entirely due to this familiar provocation, this ancient allure, that she ventured toward the murmurs, for even the persuasions of grief and the tiresome, gray ouvertures of her glum friend and acolyte, Nostalgia, would not persuade her to forgo her customary vigilance - a vigilance that she bore, indeed, like an emblem, being the sole survivor of her kindred. And in truth she had observed, throughout her wanderings, that other sole survivors also exhibited this miserable insignia&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;Princess Lothdien walked on. At one point or another, the darkness acquired a texture, and she found herself beginning to wade through it. There was magic afoot. She recognized her own vulnerability in these circumstances, but did not endeavor to mitigate it. Instead, she dreamed on toward what appeared to be the beckoning spirit of home - the commiserative mirage of buried knowledges.  
<br>
&emsp;There they were, of course. Eyeless, spiritless agents of chaos - Dagmara, barely lucid, bore down on them in a violent trance. Meanwhile, it occurred to her that she had expected this. Goblins are fairly loosely constituted; they appeared to melt underneath her blade, dropping in slabs and heavy ribbons to the stone. 
<br>
&emsp;As their compeers fell, crowds and crowds of them slumped towards her from what she assumed was their carrion, hissing and groaning. There was a foul odor aloft. Dagmara lanced them one after the other, insensitive to her own exhaustion. And then, when the whole horde lay in tranches and chunks about her feet, the warrior princess dropped to her knees and collapsed.

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style = "color: darkblue; font-size: 21px;">&#x26B1</span>
<br>

[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aqua; font-size: 21px;">7</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Monsieur La Doulaise'; color: black; font-size: 16px;"><b>S</b></span>he&#39;s traumatized <a href id = "Chapter7" class = "chapterlinks">because</a> she loves those animals! I feel so bad for her,&#34; fretted Century. "&#8230;Do you think she&#39;ll quit?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem gazed at him. Without question, he was being insincere. But then it could be said that Century had known a great number of Pins. At all events, he was enough of a professional not to enter into the emotions of his subordinates - so much the better, as far as Salem was concerned.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I hope that she does. What truly <I>happened</I>? &#8230;That&#39;s still unanswered. &#8230;You don&#39;t seem to want to respond.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem didn&#39;t usually endeavor to twist Century&#39;s arm in these subtle ways, but, without a doubt, the situation called for it, and, apart from that, he was genuinely outraged. 
<br>
&emsp;Century clutched his head.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;It was an accident, Salem! You know the ecosystems of this planet and what they are. Will I be blamed for that as well? No one can tell why they&#39;re failing... And the allocation of this airspace was sanctioned by your own government. It belongs to those two corporations now because they were the only ones who went through the proper channels. It was applied for and granted. It&#39;s <I>all</I> legal. Even you can't dispute that!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I wouldn&#39;t go so far.&#34; Salem returned.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Had Yield and HaloTech been made aware that somebody was living on Ciely?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;In the sense that they had access to the population data, yes. That is standard,&#34; Century muttered.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And so they <I>knew</I> that this world had a population of one when they began this their latest operation.&#34;
<br>
Century winced.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You&#39;re forgetting that Ciely Tau is a moon.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;It was at this point that Salem began to see through him - but he smiled.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I don&#39;t want you to advance the misconception that all moons have reverted to the military for use as testing grounds and barracks, Century - it&#39;s dangerous.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;The Cosmic Badlands Act&ndash;,&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Makes no provision for moons that I know of, and that was an oversight, in spite of what you think. One that&#39;s being corrected. But what was it? A spaceship?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No! They were&#8230; I mean&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I see. Weapons!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Century sweated with anguish.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What sort? &#8230;I can&#39;t imagine that they pulverized five warm-blooded animals from those heights and in the dead of the night based on a guess! Novel homing technologies&#34;
<br>
&emsp;There was no response. Century trembled with what Salem chose to view as shame.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I assume that you&#39;ve told Pin about this,&#34; He added.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No. She seemed&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He simply abandoned the sentence. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;<I>Please</I> understand me, Salem! No one else who qualified was even willing to consider coming all the way out to these wastes. They don&#39;t leave the Earth to be by themselves, you know - as bad as it is there. Pin is a different breed. She's a godsend because she doesn&#39;t know any different. 
&emsp;Before they went insane, both of her parents were astronauts. And she was brought up around here - on leaper farms and in sailor forests. She's almost an alien herself. And so she&#39;s a lifeline for the homeworld zoologists, so we treasure her. Believe me, Salem, none of us want anything bad to happen to her. <I>None</I> of us.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No,&#34; Salem said drily. &#34;Nor to ourselves and our interests. May I see her now?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Please! She would <I>love</I> to see you. She idolizes you&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem overlooked this. Century even knocked on Pin&#39;s arched door on his behalf. He was more than happy to suspend their conversation. When Salem heard the subdued response, he let himself in&#8230; 
<br>
&emsp;Pin sat up within her berth-like bed to receive him. Salem was quite certain that in the discussion that was to follow she would not express the slightest discontent in words. But that she had lain down during the day said quite enough.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Pin - I&#39;m so sorry.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Sorry for what?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He recollected their video call and winced internally. Brash. Overeager! He could not even be certain that she&#39;d understood what he had been trying to say. Her current expression of alarm was identical to the one that she had given him that day&#8230;  
<br>
&emsp;Over and above that awkwardness, Salem found that he felt appreciably nervous inside this room, which was full of her possessions. Or perhaps it was more accurate to say that it contained them, for Pin had very, very little. Loosely and insouciantly did the utilitarian cabin hold all of her worldliness: cooking utensils, outerwear, and standard issue technologies for out-posters. It held almost nothing. It held necessities.
<br>
&emsp;As he remarked this, Salem&#39;s eyes caught on the gigantic console that was mounted to the wall behind her bed in a blue rubber case, like a toy tablet. He could see that it was a model of the last century - a model that was today employed almost exclusively by government, which vouchsafed them to those of their servants who operated either in unsafe or in underdeveloped worlds, or in war zones. 
<br>
&emsp;Thank Christ that it was quiet here (prior to his parents&#39; divorce, Salem had been brought up within the New Dry Earth Christian Alliance). Well, that it had been quiet&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What I&#39;m sorry for is having put you in this position in the first place, along with Century. It&#39;s my fault.&#34; Seeing that she was about to protest, he continued, &#34;It goes without saying that we are all victims of chest-of-drawers politics - I mean, compartmentalization - but Century is your superior, and I am facilitating this project, and so this fiasco is not on you, but on us, and on me, primarily.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He watched her scowl without much surprise.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You didn&#39;t cause those pilots to kill Bridey and the others.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;<I>Target practice</I>, he thought unwillingly, and winced. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I know.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;When she had gained the full picture, she would be outraged. He was quite surprised that she had known the correct terminology. Somebody like Pin would still think of a pilot as somebody that flew a plane, he'd have assumed. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;They were inexperienced&#8230;&#34; he continued feebly. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;There was no debris. Did you notice?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem shuddered. He heard himself begin to use his professional voice.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Century and I are <I>entirely</I> accountable to you for everything that took place here on the twenty-fifth. Century is prepared to give you a complete and truthful pr&eacute;cis of what happened. He&#39;s been in contact with the testers at HaloTech and Yield this morning, and they were decent enough to admit their&#8230;error." On that understatement, he drew a steadying breath. "But I know how much you care about those animals, Pin. I can&#39;t tell you <I>how</I> sorry I am.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Pin gazed at him. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;&#8230;That was almost a quarter of Bridey&#39;s generation. I suppose we couldn&#39;t have stopped it. We can&#39;t stop it - leapers are doomed to extinction. They&#39;re all so ill. But&#8230;but&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You loved Bridey. You treasured them. I understand.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Salem didn&#39;t, and they were both cognizant of that fact, and both let it pass. And Pin remarked to herself for the hundred thousandth time, but on the first occasion on that day, his comical incongruity with her entire environment. And, as always, she remarked it with a true and deep pleasure. Today, he was like a moonbeam standing in her small cabin. A column of glitter on the floorboards&#8230; 
<br>
&emsp;And, though Pin was irreducibly smitten, she happened also to like and admire Salem personally, for she had found that he made continual efforts to put her at ease and also that he took his work, though it may be of an airier nature, as seriously as she took hers - an unforeseen similarity and one that she would have certainly considered impossible had she thought of it. Somehow, Pin did not associate a willingness to work, or to adorn the yoke of responsibility, with Ioans, or indeed with metropolitan-cosmopolitans in general&#8230; Yet Salem took it on with cheer. He truly seemed to a prodigious extent to enjoy looking after things and people. And he was gifted to be so natural about it that she could also be his friend. 
<br>
&emsp;But Pin firmly believed that even if he hadn&#39;t been so gifted, and the two of them, as might originally have been expected, did not speak the same language, Salem would always have had the gift of her devotion - such as it was. Pin had been inculcated from early childhood by world-weary parents with a clear consciousness of fate. She did not usually name the sensation fate for she differed in this from her parents, who had begun their careers and marriage as academics: that her approaches to language were charier. There was very little poetry in Pin, and, secretly, she despised both wit and discussion. 
<br>
&emsp;She did possess, however, a particular reverence for the part of her that chose its supports: her instincts - her psyche. And, as has been demonstrated, what that part had chosen was Salem. Pin cherished him absolutely, and her earthy soul consolidated itself beneath that unconscious decision, as it had under only a handful of others in the course of her tranquil life. 
<br>
&emsp;For the first time - gloomy in the freshness of the late morning, which was unseasonably cool, and which bloomed with a faint, low, striated lilac fog, whose ill-defined loveliness was, in her estimation, one of the splendidest weather events on Ciely Tau, and gazing at him - Pin wondered whether he could somehow sense all of this.
