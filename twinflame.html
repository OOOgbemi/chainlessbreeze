[<span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: aquamarine; font-size: 21px;">1</span>] <span style = "font-family: 'Great Vibes'; color: black; font-size: 16px;">T</span>he dome winked its tears of fluid light, flashing in stripes upon the lumpy, blue flora. The ground seemed to leap, and Mide started, before realizing what it was: a phantasm. Balancing on the threshold, he squinted up and saw the wispy, gleaming trails run to the rim, like reins cut from a chariot. Dotun and Ai were still both fast asleep indoors. 
<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;The water stood inside the painted hydria on the porch. Because he had been ill in the past month, their neighbor David had been the one to fetch it for them from the desalination plant. But Mide wanted the chore back. He was deeply fond of the desalination plant, whose winding chambers had always looked to him like the carcass of a mighty, paleocene snake. He used to cycle there in the electric blue evenings, feeling alone and light of heart. 
<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;Drinking in the mists of morning that glissaded in white across the soil, he recalled, smilingly, the earnestness with which Ai and his sister had battled him over that particular errand. The principal point of contention had been his desire to go on his own. They still believed the stories about interlopers, which were true, but not in the ways they imagined. 
<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;He lifted the hydria to carry it indoors, wincing because his bones still felt pulpy. It had been years and years since he was ill, and so the sensations had all come as almost total surprises. Because he was a person who loved surprise, the admixture of true pleasure with the horrid discomforts of his malady had really, really unnerved him. More and more often, his emotional states were dialectical.
<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;Mide set the hydria down next to the stove. He would have to go over to David’s house, once he had dressed, and let him know that there was no longer any need for help. 
<br> 

<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;Ai returned with an armful of breakfast when it was almost midday. Mide hadn’t gone to see David because it had seemed peaceful in their front room, where the milky light of late morning pooled through the papered windows. He was on the floor, reading one of the history books that Dotun had brought him from the craft. 
He could hear her singing something through the arched corridor that led to her bedroom, but there was a muffled, narrowed quality to her voice due to the softness of the walls. As he read, he took careful stock of the sensations in his body in an unrushed manner. He wanted to know what was the same, since he had been ill, and what was different. 
He observed a certain woolliness, which meant that he couldn’t stick to particular trains of thought for long, though he could read and handle other tasks with focus. It was a little like how he felt when walking on ground that was slippery. An activity was like a handrail, but he felt tense when he freewheeled. 
His joints hurt him a little bit, including those in his jaw. But it wasn’t an entirely unpleasant feeling. It was like the stiffness that gives us the desire to stretch. He had just begun to stretch when Ai came back into the house. She’d wrapped her bounty in a deep green cloth, and she beamed as she knelt down before him to spread it out.
He watched as she took the first bite of an earthberry. They called it that because it looked like a combination of various different aggregate fruits from the old world. The juice was black, and it pooled at the corners of her mouth before she licked it off.
“Have some!” She said.
It was tart almost to the point of bitterness. Here, it grew in and around the streamlets. 
“How do you feel?” She asked.
“Healthy,” he said.
They sat cross-legged on the rug, facing one another.
