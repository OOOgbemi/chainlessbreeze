&emsp;Deji was jostled from his seat again - and again. One of these meatheads had failed to configure the zipcuffs correctly, and so he could have used both arms to steady himself if he dared, but he didn&#39;t dare. There were two pilots. One wore a mask, but not the other&#8230; He had never before been in a battleship that was operating as one. 
<br>
&emsp;And the masked pilot might have been unconscious, for all of the gestures he appeared to make. He wore a special, thin glove, however, and narrated each action in a calm whisper as he took it. Deji had heard it said that HaloTech mercenaries were required to do so as a matter of protocol even in battle - a question of protocol. The current fiasco was not a battle yet, happily, but a chase&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;For the twentieth time since his capture, Deji insisted to himself that he must not be the sole plunder. But, of course, he knew exactly what was taking place. The masked pilot spoke at a slightly greater volume to his headset, and then they banked left, which was nauseating, appalling&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;With his feet, he felt around the floor of the cabin for some sort of latch, or a lever. If he found one, what he intended to do was to unstrap himself quietly, open it, and tumble through. It would be over before anybody knew it. But then a crimson blaze splattered the rear starboard windows, and the ship dipped, as though it had been it, though it hadn&#39;t. Deji squinted at the backs and profiles of the six mercenaries who sat directly before him. Not even a shadow of tension. He reminded himself that this was not by any means their first rodeo. Banking again, he felt the shudder of something in the galley as their own artillery was engaged. Pure madness! 
<br>
&emsp;Deji was dismally and excruciatingly aware, from his own experience, that Lolade could, whenever she wanted, make herself angry enough to overbrim with ecstatic mirth - a hilarious rage. Lolade was their pursuer. He had seen it before - several times. Now, he imagined her giggling, having shed her security detail to wager the lives of her crew in a senseless game of possession. 
<br>
&emsp;Just the previous night, when he and she were safe, and preparing for this very ordeal, she had revealed, behind vermeil gates, in a courtyard moist with the glow of stars, both to the moons and to himself, that she did not intend to witness the end of her work. Too much pleasure could amount to a curse, just as too much wealth, and she had been unscrupulous throughout her life - and a hell of alot of other nonsense to that effect. It was fairly soon, but could this be what had been turning in her mind?
<br>
&emsp;Even the starlight could not make her beautiful; he cursed her for the hundredth time and wriggled clear of  his restraints. No one was paying him the slightest bit of attention, and he wanted to die. The Ussian mesosphere would finish him quickly. He asked for no more.
<br>
&emsp;As he attempted to center himself in an awareness of what he was about to do - for he would not do it with his eyes shut - he observed that it was curiously both bright and dark in the cabin. A wide band of luminescent mist seemed to drift up from below the ship, meeting, however, a deep, black, blankness, like a sheet of velvet, that devoured it. And then there were the cheerful and motley controls, that winked continuously from dark consoles and beeped their songs. All of a sudden, he could tell precisely where the hatch was. It was behind him - almost under his seat. If he dropped to the floor, he didn&#39;t expect that his captors would notice for a couple of seconds&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;But when he did it, it in fact caused a great deal of confusion. First, he was yanked up by the collar. None of the mercenaries could rise to their full heights within that space, which fortunately kept them off balance. At the next jolt, he was released. He tried to crawl, noting meanwhile that the mercenaries did not speak a word to one another, but merely acted. At a violent dip, he hit his head on the steel underside of his seat, having gotten beneath it. Someone took hold of both of his ankles and heaved him back. He caught the right leg of the chair, which was bolted, and scrabbled furiously with his other hand until he had located the peg and the lever. 
<br>
&emsp;Colors ricocheted across the walls. It occurred to Deji that he must have distracted the pilots; they were being shot at with much greater accuracy now&#8230; He removed the peg and yanked on the lever. It would have been far easier to fall out feet first. As things stood, he was squarely in the path of the guns. 
<br>
&emsp;Outside, it felt neither cold nor hot. He had not yet attempted to draw breath, but he could sense that it would not work. He kicked hard and felt himself being drawn downward into the flashing heavens.
<br>
-
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I saw him! I saw him dangling there. Why wouldn&#39;t I be sure? I was the one who bought that silver spacesuit. I had it made for him.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;He didn&#39;t want to die among strangers.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No, he was sabotaging them - for <I>me</I>.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Niyi was silent. Above them, milky swirls of fawn marble designed a cosmos of their own on the ceilings. It was his very first day living with Lolade in the palace.
