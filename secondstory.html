&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Everything around gave an impression of dryness. The <i>thwack</i> of the tennis ball and its neon fuzz. The hideousness of that color. The clop of the clay court, and the shushing of shoes on it. The unmelting paint of the bleachers, which was duller than any green in any of the world&#39;s forests&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Only the players seemed saturated because both of them poured with sweat. But what Dele had found recently was that she couldn&#39;t sweat - and she knew why. She supposed that if a person held absolutely nothing back (particularly under the sun), then they would drop dead.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>Thwack. Huff.</i> The umpire studied them like a lighthouse. Nire won, of course. It was his brilliant and languid service. Dele could admit that that part came naturally to him. He had achieved extremely nice aces in every game. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Congratulations flowed, as did the electrolyte water. It was too hot. His opponent, tired, had made a hasty exit to the bus. She leaned against him while he laughed with his coaches under the eye of the sky. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was the apex of the term, and not very many people had gathered to watch. But, of those that were there, Dele could tell which were first-years who still had no social circle, and which knew the team. The sight of the first-years - the spectacle of their insecurity - recalled to her an old self whom she had slain. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Things were so different now. The outfits of the first-years were palatable in the extreme. And the vivid strings of their lanyards escaped from their back pockets. Nire took her back to her hall. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He put his racquet bag down on the gray, decent carpet. He sat in her desk chair. Dele hovered on the edge of her neatly made bed, chewing on ice from his aluminum bottle. The entire hall was unusually cool that day. Nire observed her in his whites by the window. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele was thinking of her friend Lucien from Monaco, who had invited her to an ambient music concert in total darkness that evening. The warped peals of the carillon that lived in the university chapel quaked through the wide window. It had taken Dele almost nine months to figure out what that noise was on Thursday evenings. Only after a chance meeting with a carillonneur at a foreign studentsâ€™ social had she connected the dots&#8230; The carillonneur was the first person whom she had ever met from Denmark. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#34;Are you ready?&#34; Nire asked.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele nodded. Then they began. He took his bottle and his racquet bag and left her room. Her next-door neighbor had a phonograph with a stereo, and through the adjoining wall she could hear The Little Purple Flower.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele patched herself up and then went to see Lucien. By that time, the sun was relinquishing this hot pink lustre to leagues of spires and gables and to the facets of glass libraries. Lucien lived in a decrepit shared house on the southern edge of campus. The house was beautiful. Its spirit was a silvery kitten that had no owner and no name.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once again, Dele heard music as she walked through their peeling door, which was always ajar, dangerously. This time, it was coming from one of the bedrooms on the ground floor. Familiar highlife. Music to cool existence, which was so hot&#8230; She wandered up the stairs.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lucien had the attic room and could unfortunately only stand up in one end of it. But the size of the attic made it a comfortable dwelling, and she had lain round pillows down over two rugs and between lamps for her guests to sit on.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The walls, she had draped with intriguing textiles, contrary to fire code, including her own crochet experiments and a large sheet of <i>adire</i>, which had been a birthday present from Dele, and which served as a partial curtain. At dawn, because of it, all the corners of the attic turned indigo, a halcyon effect that Lucien and Dele both cherished. But Lucien wasn&#39;t in the room.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele shut the door, feeling warm and faint. She loved the attic. Lucien had bought two cheap standing lamps from another student and painted the shades with subtle, rectilinear patterns using gloss. This meant that the lamps drew quiet angles on the dull floorboards when they were on and it was sufficiently dark, as it was now. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The concert would not begin for another three or four hours. They had planned to go out for dinner beforehand. Dele lay down in Lucien&#39;s unmade bed and went to sleep. Her sleep was populated with shoals of thought. It was unusually watery, thin, and lucent. None of the thoughts lingered. They flashed iridescent flanks at her and then swam away&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But she missed Nire, and that was the overall tone and tenor of her dream. The grimness of that, in light of his success in athletics. Game - set - match! Dele then wished a bitter wish. Her cells subsisted and proliferated. She wished that she had never given him her blood. 
<br>
<span style = "color: lawngreen;"><a href id = "Ch2">&#x22F0</a></span>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But the concert was good. It was good to stand, first in a red basement, and then in empty space listening to unexpectedly raw sounds. Lucien burrowed into the experience easily. It was her favorite music. She had even dressed up a bit to honor it, though no one could see her, or the spangled, white neckerchief which glorified the delicacy and length of her neck. She certainly left her friend behind spiritually, but Dele didn&#39;t mind that, since the night was temperate. Being drained, she&#39;d long realized that she couldn&#39;t keep up with her generation. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The other spooks and phantoms leaned harmlessly against the walls, between claustrophobia warnings. She had glimpsed them against the uneven brick when first they descended into calm, crimson radiance. Lucien hadn&#39;t seemed to notice. She was certain that they kept all of their prey at home.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele had eyed them with a very indecorous curiosity when they first came down, and now she found that her sheepishness had grown arms and legs. Lucien was oblivious. The furnace of her insecurity gurgled under their eyes. She had felt much better when the lights initially went out, but then she recollected that darkness concealed nothing from those people.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lucien had never been drained, and anyone could tell that. She was barely aware of the gruesome and storybook possibility, from what Dele had been able to glean over the course of their friendship, which had begun in January, in a literary theory class. That night, as the air heaved with noise, billowed, and then settled, Dele reminisced with clarity. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She saw Lucien in the snow, mittened as always, in the mittens that she had made, fidgeting under a silver constructivist titan, which the students nicknamed &#39;the paperclip,&#39; waiting for her. Dele was usually late, being by nature and from her earliest childhood, sluggish. A sluggish individual. Lucien had been waiting because they both volunteered with the women&#39;s center at their university, which, that winter, had been putting together care packages of gloves, thermal underwear, and hygiene essentials and delivering them to unhoused women around the city. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was during these deliveries that the two had really gotten to know one another. Or, rather, it was during these deliveries that Dele had discovered a warm shelter for herself in the backdrop of Lucien&#39;s character. Lucien was kind, beautiful, and self-aware. She had been in therapy for most of her life, though she adored her cosmopolitan parents and her devout sister. Lucien&#39;s sister, from what Dele had gathered, was a monk with no self-existence and had been a scholar of emptiness in Nepal.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They had both grown up in a futuristic idyll. A safe place full of holidaymakers. It would never occur to Lucien to lift a finger to take care of anybody else - she was not moved by pity in any degree - and this quality acted on Dele like a spell. She volunteered at the women&#39;s center because she liked it, and it gave her pleasure, and because she had chosen to make volunteering the foundation of her social life. The deterrent of obligation was utterly unfamiliar to her, or perhaps it had been excised in her treatment.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But Dele was beginning to think that Lucien had made herself a prime target.
