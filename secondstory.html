&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Everything around gave an impression of dryness. The <i>thwack</i> of the tennis ball and its neon fuzz. The hideousness of that color. The clop of the clay court, and the shushing of shoes on it. The unmelting paint of the bleachers, which was duller than any green in any of the world&#39;s forests&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Only the players seemed saturated because both of them poured with sweat. But what Dele had found recently was that she couldn&#39;t sweat - and she knew why. She supposed that if a person held absolutely nothing back (particularly under the sun), then they would drop dead.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>Thwack. Huff.</i> The umpire studied them like a lighthouse. Nire won, of course. It was his brilliant and languid service. Dele could admit that that part came naturally to him. He had achieved extremely nice aces in every game. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Congratulations flowed, as did the electrolyte water. It was too hot. His opponent, tired, had made a hasty exit to the bus. She leaned against him while he laughed with his coaches under the eye of the sky. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was the apex of the term, and not very many people had gathered to watch. But, of those that were there, Dele could tell which were first-years who still had no social circle, and which knew the team. The sight of the first-years - the spectacle of their insecurity - recalled to her an old self whom she had slain. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Things were so different now. The outfits of the first-years were palatable in the extreme. And the vivid strings of their lanyards escaped from their back pockets. Nire took her back to her hall. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He put his racquet bag down on the gray, decent carpet. He sat in her desk chair. Dele hovered on the edge of her neatly made bed, chewing on ice from his aluminum bottle. The entire hall was unusually cool that day. Nire observed her in his whites by the window. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele was thinking of her friend Lucien from Monaco, who had invited her to an ambient music concert in total darkness that evening. The warped peals of the carillon that lived in the university chapel quaked through the wide window. It had taken Dele almost nine months to figure out what that noise was on Thursday evenings. Only after a chance meeting with a carillonneur at a foreign studentsâ€™ social had she connected the dots&#8230; The carillonneur was the first person whom she had ever met from Denmark. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#34;Are you ready?&#34; Nire asked.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele nodded. Then they began. He took his bottle and his racquet bag and left her room. Her next-door neighbor had a phonograph with a stereo, and through the adjoining wall she could hear The Little Purple Flower.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele patched herself up and then went to see Lucien. By that time, the sun was relinquishing this hot pink lustre to leagues of spires and gables and to the facets of glass libraries. Lucien lived in a decrepit shared house on the southern edge of campus. The house was beautiful. Its spirit was a silvery kitten that had no owner and no name.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once again, Dele heard music as she walked through their peeling door, which was always ajar, dangerously. This time, it was coming from one of the bedrooms on the ground floor. Familiar highlife. Music to cool existence, which was so hot&#8230; She wandered up the stairs.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lucien had the attic room and could unfortunately only stand up in one end of it. But the size of the attic made it a comfortable dwelling, and she had lain round pillows down over two rugs and between lamps for her guests to sit on.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The walls, she had draped with intriguing textiles, contrary to fire code, including her own crochet experiments and a large sheet of <i>adire</i>, which had been a birthday present from Dele, and which served as a partial curtain. At dawn, because of it, all the corners of the attic turned indigo, a halcyon effect that Lucien and Dele both cherished. But Lucien wasn&#39;t in the room.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dele shut the door, feeling warm and faint. She loved the attic. Lucien had brought two cheap standing lamps from another student and painted the shades with subtle, rectilinear patterns using gloss. This meant that the lamps drew quiet angles on the dull floorboards when they were on and it was sufficiently dark, as it was now. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The concert would not begin for another three or four hours. They had planned to go out for dinner beforehand. Dele lay down in Lucien&#39;s unmade bed and went to sleep. Her sleep was populated with shoals of thought. It was unusually watery, thin, and lucent. None of the thoughts lingered. They flashed iridescent flanks at her and then swam away&#8230;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But she missed Nire, and that was the overall tone and tenor of her dream. The grimness of that, in light of his success in athletics. Game - set - match! Dele then wished a bitter wish. Her cells subsisted and proliferated. She wished that she had never given him her blood.
