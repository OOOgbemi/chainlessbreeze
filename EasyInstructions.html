Answer&#x2a; these SIX questions and you will finally be a poet...but remember! The idea is a poetry practice for everyone guided by self-pity &#224; la Highsmith. We can all do it.

<span style = "font-size: 10px;">&#x2a;I have no way of collecting your answers and no wish to. However, it is very important in the context for this exercise and other reasons that you feel secure enough to be honest with yourself. Instead of typing your answers here, feel free to use a notebook or whatever feels most private. &#x263A</span>
