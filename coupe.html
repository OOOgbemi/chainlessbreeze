<u><b>Coupe</b></u>
<br>
&emsp;At dawn, a red light pulsed from certain of the highest clouds. A phenomenon familiar to those of us who lived in this part of the world; it meant a brilliant day. As was the one, hot drop where the setting sun burned through tissues of sky on a gloomy evening. The world&#39;s most voluptuous oranges, swaddled in the deepest, maternal blue&#8230; 
<br>
&emsp;I dressed myself in the grayish, pinkish light, managing to think of nothing while doing it, and then I drove out into the hoariness of the day. The landscape offered very little nourishment to the imagination - it seemed almost calculatedly dull - thus I felt I had been bestowed the opportunity to enumerate points of progress. After months and months of healing, Oju could by the grace of God once again perceive coincidence. She also understood jokes better, and she could laugh at herself, or not, as the mood took her. In short, she had regained the ability to be surprised.
<br>
&emsp;It was a relief, especially as I had been forced to realize in recent weeks that I, too, was starting to run down. My power to bear life, too, was limited - as it turned out. It became even more apparent - came into greater relief for me, as it were - when I turned into and began drawing up their horrid escarpment of a drive. The cool aura of their whitewashed mansion and the gloom of the dour garden that flanked it sunk my internal temperature. There are silent strains which we all endure in the depths of our beings, and I had been given no language with which to excavate that species of problem. I could act as a trestle - I had shown that to myself, and it had come as a great surprise. I could be a sound support for other people. But, within myself, like most people, I stood upon pillars of sand. 
<br>
&emsp;Climbing out of the car, I caught a glimpse of her leaning out from her little tower on the third floor. I saw that her black hair was down, and that she was eye to eye with the old yew, but that she looked at me, that in fact she was on the lookout. I thought, <I>and so she&#39;s been waiting.</I>
<br>
&emsp;Feelings of responsibility, ultimately indistinguishable from the onus of my role as family friend, which was exactly that - no more and no less than a role - overran me again. And particular aspects of my nature, which I suspected himself of being only too glad to relinquish, sublimated rapidly. It was just like time travel - it was in short hypocrisy.  
<br>
&emsp;The mist was dwindling away under a mild heat from the ivory sun. She had wanted, as always, to drive with the top down, even though it was chill and humid in the shade. There was a winter smell aloft: people&#39;s hearths. She was talking to me about Nunzia; new theories, I noted with alarm. Her younger brother had not offered me any warning words as I took her away, on this occasion, but he had given me a level, baleful stare, and I thought I knew what that meant. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Surely - surely - Nunzia wouldn&#39;t leave you alone?&#34; I was saying.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;She never tells us where she&#39;s going. She hates us. She keeps things from us. She has secrets&#8230;&#34; And on and on. 
<br>
&emsp;For my part, I thought it might be a bit of a madcap decision to lie in a field in all of that dampness, with her in that state of mind. But she wasn&#39;t willing to have a change in routine, and I wasn&#39;t willing to become insistent. We settled down on the side of a hill, in view of horses, sheep, and cows, and Oju kept on talking about her grandmother&#39;s secrets.
<br>
&emsp;I waited for her to get it out of her system, watching the black-headed sheep as they grazed in the valley alongside us. A number of them wore fluorescent blue identification marks on their muddy fleece. A secret sounded like pure, heavy luxury to me. And it is. Confidences - if I could only begin to have those! But it was her time to be conscious of her grievances, to list them. Then our holiday could begin.
<br>
&emsp;I was conscious of dreaming a little - the clouds were as opaque as milk against the crystal sky. And I recollected that when the sun began to set, the blues would separate, thus diluting the milk&#8230; Bronze would then be introduced, or, on inclement days, rose. A voltaic rose, pulsing like a current of desire.
<br>
&emsp;I claimed to myself once again that I would forgive Oju her fragility. She had never once asked me about my work. So much the better. She could never bear to hear about havoc.
