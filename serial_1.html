<br>
&emsp;&emsp;So she wandered off, leaving the boy, and going toward the blankness of her future. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The first being that she encountered on her journey was a nut. As soon as she laid eyes on it, she knew what it was because she had seen an old woman who lived alone on the outskirts of her village holding a basket of such nuts - carrying them home. It was well known that the old woman harvested them to eat. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The eldest sister ate one, for she hadn’t tasted food in many days, and as she ate she had good thoughts and ingested positive dreams. She felt the true and deep significance of all she had done that was right, and it strengthened her to bear the vertigo of inevitability and the inevitability of wrongdoing. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Eventually, she reached a valley of cool air and the blue stream of her premonition. A broad stream of clean, fresh water. There, she sat down to drink, expecting at any moment to have to carve language with the people of the circular, thatched houses who inhabited the valley. Their entire settlement had the odor of clay. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;But time passed, and her thirst was quenched, and no one joined her. She relaxed, and her relaxation brought memories of her trials as always. She thought of the family she had left, the son, the siblings with whom she had once shared a face, and whom, to her, now looked like strangers. Her body was covered in scars from the mouth of the beast whom she had gone to voluntarily and wed, in order to learn and help. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;It was midday. She was a site of destruction, aching. The orange sun rejoiced and raged. She observed the plump bushes that grew next to the circular houses, each of them blooming with pepper. She rested her back against the trunk of a tall tree that grew next to the blessed stream, and whose leaves were as big as empress’ fans, and she slept.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;A hunter woke her up. She knew him for a hunter by his dog, his charm, and his cutlass. She hoped that he would be able to tell the difference between herself and his prey, for otherwise, she would have to eat him. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“Speak, that I may know whether or not you be a witch.”
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Sister didn’t say a word. The very worst thing that she could do would be to respond to him in his own language, for she could not have explained to him how she, a stranger, knew it. She was tired. He studied her clothing and her broken shoes. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“Have you drunk from the river?”
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Subterfuge. She heard it for what it was, and still she could not prevent the harried questions that sprouted from her head. What significance could a river possibly have to a hunter, a dog, and a witch? The world was a minefield of symbols, and there were no right answers. Where else was a creature to find water in this horrid landscape?
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“Stand up and let me look at your ankles.”
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;She stood and showed them to him, and from his facial expression, she deduced that they were blameless.
<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;“Turn back into a fish and swim away,” He advised her. “For if you don’t, they will murder you.”
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;There was hope in his voice. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;She said, “Stop giving me orders.”
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;She had surprised herself with this remark, but then she was at the end of her tether. His own surprise and awe showed in his slackened jaw. She had not spoken his language, nor had she used her own. She had chosen a third language, which was understood by everybody, but spoken only by very few, most of whom were not human. But these facts exhausted her.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“Kill me, if you want,” she said to the hunter. “No one will avenge my death, for I have wandered far from home.”
<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Sister had been in flight. The time came when it began to seem foolish to her not to acknowledge this. But he and the other people who were with him were helpless, and she had discovered that there was nothing sacred about the river. 
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;She, at least, could speak to time and understand the seasons, the five-spokes on the axle of the year. These villagers, like so many others, were hanging themselves with their amulets.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The hunter refrained from showing her violence and brought her to the home of a learned woman. This woman could tell by looking at her face that she had given birth in the last year, but as she had studied books, she could not have told to what. The woman lived alone, and Sister suspected that she treated the villagers’ spiritual ailments and did so poorly.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;It was sunset when the hunter left her at this woman’s dwelling, and she was wrong about something. She had assumed that the reason why the hunter did not harm her was because he believed her to be a witch and was frightened. But in reality he knew her to be a witch and also knew what that meant. His mother was a witch, and now she spoke to him from beyond the grave. Because he knew that the dead live in us, he practiced his own, layperson’s magic, which was that of hospitality. He was not frightened.
